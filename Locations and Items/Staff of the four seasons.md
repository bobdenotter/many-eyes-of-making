# Staff of the Four Seasons
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a nature cleric, druid, oath of the ancients paladin, warlock, wizard, or sorcerer)_

This magical staff changes with the seasons. You can spend ten minutes concentrating on the staff to change it to a different season. It remains in this new form for the next 8 hours before reverting to the current season again.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, your melee attacks with the staff deal an extra 1d8 cold (Winter), radiant (Spring), fire (Summer), or necrotic (Autumn) damage based on the season as long as there is at least one charge remaining on the staff.

This staff has 8 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it as an action (depending on the season) using your spell attack modifier spell save DC:

**Winter.** _Ray of sickness_ (1 charge), _darkvision_ (2 charges), _sleet storm_ (3 charges)  
**Spring.** _Guiding bolt_ (1 charge), _moonbeam_ (2 charges), _plant growth_ (3 charges)  
**Summer.** _Burning hands_ (1 charge), _spike growth_ (2 charges), _fireball_ (3 charges)  
**Autumn.** _Inflict wounds_ (1 charge), _pass without trace_ (2 charges), _vampiric touch_ (3 charges)

The staff regains 1d6 +2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all foliage and vitality, becoming a gnarled, nonmagical quarterstaff.

  
> Time changes everyone and everything. Like the seasons, nothing lasts forever.
