# Blade Desert & Endworld mountains


* **Maerin** - Tent city near an oasis. On the foot of the Endworld mountains, in the blade desert.
* **Krezent** - Abandoned mountain village. A disaster took place here three years ago. Possibly a manifest zone to the plain of dreams; Dal'Quor.
* **The Boneyard** - Canyon filled with Giant, Dragon and Elven bones. Meeting ground for a last-ditch effort to solve an issue with Dal'Quor the diplomatic way. Has been lying here for more then 10.000 years. Where the group met [[Arag]].
