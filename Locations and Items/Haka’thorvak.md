Lost dragonborn city in the jungle.

 Notable locations:  

* **Temple of Luminescent Blight** Temple raised in honor of the sacrifice Rhashaak made for the Dragonborn in continously battling the cold sun underneath the city and being exposed to his corruption
* **Amphitheater** Mainly destroyed and water-logged, but a relatively safe place to stay within the city
* **Barracks** The upper-levels are dominated by a massive bassilisk called Emrath, the lower levels and actual barracks have been taken over by the Blackscale lizardfolk.
