# Vvaraaks' Prophecy
 [[Vvaraak]]'s contribution to the [[Draconic Propecy]], that doesn't seem to be taken seriously by most other dragons. The prophecy seems to refer to the location of the shattered pieces of the Eye of [[Arag]], a crystal used to communicate with the plane of Dal'Quor before it was shattered into five pieces.

> Recount the failures of he who walked in dreams
His large crystal coming apart at the seams  
The first eye lands where Eberron is breaking  
Twisted into something not worth Making  
The giants second eye, a tempest swallowed whole  
An isle full of thieves still pays its yearly toll  
Eyes of third lie in precious treasure  
Darkness surrounding preventing any measure  
The fourth eye is blinded by the trees  
Corroded scales now looking over its keys  
And fifth, where frozen wastes will arise in  
The mist folds into the unknown horizon
