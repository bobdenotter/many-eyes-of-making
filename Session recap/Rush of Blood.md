# Rush of Blood

As Galen continues climbing down the rope ladder to get to the statue of one of Nerima’s lieutenants, the others now also notice [[Rashaak]] emerging from the tar pit. Though the black dragon doesn’t seem to have noticed them, Beck still turns to Petr, asking him to ready the ship in case they have to make a quick escape. Bonzo, looking at how far away [[Rashaak]] is and knowing how fast he moved previously, knows they won’t have a lot of time to get away if the dragon does start approaching them, which he alerts the others to. 

Positioning himself near the helm, Petr has a better view of where [[Rashaak]] is, noticing a small humanoid figure near the dragon, which seems to be pointing the dragon in the direction of the Heritage. As [[Rashaak]] starts approaching the ship, the crew prepares to help Galen hoist the statue up towards the ship, Bonzo dropping a rope over the side of the ship as Rydia moves over to help him pull. Meanwhile, [[Nerima]] pops out her wings and flies down to help Galen with the statue. 

With the dragon now fast approaching, Petr lowers the ship so that Galen and [[Nerima]] can tie the rope around the statue, which in turn alerts [[Emrath]], the basilisk, to their presence. Up til that point, Beck’s Silence point kept the creature unaware, but now that the ship has been lowered, he spots it and starts moving up to where Galen and [[Nerima]] are, attacking the both of them. 

With the aid of Bonzo’s catapult and Beck throwing up an image of a wall of fire between the basilisk and Galen and [[Nerima]], the latter two manage to tie the rope around the statue. Galen starts climbing back up the rope ladder as Rydia and Petr, who’s made his way over to help with the rope, manage to start pulling the statue up. With the statue attached and most of the crew aboard the ship, Bonzo starts moving the ship away from the now fast approaching [[Rashaak]].

Back on deck, Galen starts helping Rydia pulling the statue up as [[Nerima]] manages to fly up to the ship as well as it starts moving away. Petr moves back over to the helm, taking over from Bonzo as he and Beck move to the back of the ship, trying to slow [[Rashaak]] down as the black dragon continues pursuing them. 

He catches up sooner than later, slamming into the ship, which moves the statue onto the deck and throws Bonzo off his feet, but Petr manages to move the ship away from [[Rashaak]] again. Realising the temple might be the only place they’ll be safe from the black dragon, Beck suggests they head to the temple so Petr turns the Heritage around, steering in the direction of the palace. 

Asking Rydia what [[Vvaraak]] looks like, Beck uses her description to conjure up an image of the green dragon, making it appear from the cliffs and sending it straight in the direction of [[Rashaak]]. This buys the crew some time as Bonzo heads into the engine room, rigging up the engine to make the ship go faster. 

Though [[Rashaak]] is temporarily distracted by the illusion of [[Vvaraak]], he soon sees through the illusion and starts heading back towards the ship. As he approaches, [[Nerima]] uses a restoration spell to turn her lieutenant, Jondar, back into his dragonborn self. Rydia, meanwhile, joins Beck on the back of the ship, the both of them preparing to at least try and fend off [[Rashaak]] as he’s fast approaching again.

The ship speeds up as Bonzo successfully turns some knobs and vents in the engine room, but the black dragon still comes pretty close. On the back of the ship, Rydia turns to Beck. “Oh, he thinks Vvaraak isn’t here,” she says in a mischievous whisper. Beck asks her what she’s going to do, to which Rydia says “Me? Oh, to [[Rashaak]]…”

As she speaks his name, a green eye appears on her cheek and as she keeps her normal eyes fixed on Beck, the green eye finds the black dragon as she uses Vvaraak’s Psychic Lance, dealing a lot of damage to [[Rashaak]], who is also sent plummeting to the ground due to the spell. 

This allows them to put some distance between the ship and him, so Galen starts gathering up the keys they’ll need to enter the temple as Beck looks around for somewhere they might be able to put the ship where [[Rashaak]] won’t be able to spot it. With Galen and Bonzo’s help, the three of them are able to spot that a large part of the city near the temple is still under an illusion spell, so they think they might be able to hide the ship inside an illusion of a building.

Petr starts navigating the ship down there and though [[Rashaak]] does start pursuing the ship again, he soon finds himself distracted by a delegation of the Poison Dusk clan, who are shooting arrows at him as he flies by the cliffs. This allows the crew the chance to set the ship down, Petr sliding it into the illusion of a building as Bonzo manages to shut down some valves in the engine room, successfully stopping the engine from heating up too much. 

Now floating about five feet off the ground, the ship is completely covered by the illusionary building. Not wanting to waste any time, the crew are quick to agree when [[Nerima]] offers to lead them to the entrance of the temple. The massive copper doors they found only a day before is still there, as well as the three triangular divots that the keys are supposed to go into. 

[[Nerima]] says that she’s happy to accompany them, suggesting that [[Jondar]] can stay back and keep watch in case [[Rashaak]] returns and finds the ship. He will give them a signal if that happens. She then takes out one of the keys, putting it in the right shape as Galen puts in the others, the two of them unlocking the door.

The lines that are sticky with red blood all seem to pulse for a moment before the doors slide open, some veins getting cut off, as the doors clearly haven’t been open for a long while. They find themselves staring into a curved hallway. It’s dark, they can see massive cobwebs lining the twenty foot high ceilings. The place doesn’t look well kept, per say, but it does look like it used to be fancy. 

The walls in these halls all contain alcoves, every ten feet or so, and in these are upright sarcophagi with lids of stone. Some contain pieces of dragonshard they can see gleaming in the daylight. Galen also notices crystalline gargoyles perched on little ledges, on the ceiling, every twenty feet or so, the same ones they’ve seen around the city. 

“I’m with you all the way, but I have to be honest, this is my first time entering here as well,” [[Nerima]] admits, saying she doesn’t know the way. Galen takes the lead, saying this is his specialty as Beck asks Bonzo for some light, so he lights up his wrench. 

Checking for traps, Galen turns down the left hallway as Bonzo starts ritually casting Detect Magic, trailing after the rest of the group as he does so. Thick vines grow on the walls, some of them creeping into the main hall, Galen noticing that some of them seem to be moving. He takes a path to stay clear of them, urging the others to follow behind him, which they do. 

The hallway goes further to the left and eventually ends at a pair of double doors made of wood, with gold accents. There’s a draconic face depicted on a knocker. There’s no clear keyhole on the door. Taking a look at the door, Galen senses that it’s magically locked, something that Bonzo’s Detect Magic spell confirms. The school of magic is Abjuration.  

The two of them share this with the others, so Petr then steps forward, casting Dispel Magic on the door per Bonzo’s suggestion, which gets rid of the arcane lock that kept the door closed. As the door opens, all the gargoyles perched near the ceiling turn to look at the group. They don’t seem to do anything, but are now staring at them. 

Galen continues taking the lead, finding himself in a room containing numerous books. It looks like a library. Shelves are carved into the rock, the ceiling is painted blue with gems inlaid in them seeming to portray constellations and moon charts. All the books seem to be the same size, they all seem to have the same binding as well, which upon closer inspection turns out to be dragon skin. All colors of dragon skin, and the books seem to be color coordinated. 

There’s a singular desk at the center of the room, made of stone, with dragon claw shaped feet that grasp into the stone of the temple itself. At the opposite end of the room, there’s another door. Bonzo’s Detect Magic spell reveals that both the door, as well as all the books in the room, have an arcane lock spell on them as well. The books do also have small keyholes on their spines.

“I don’t think we should touch the books,” Bonzo says, as Rydia says she was about to ask Galen how many weeks he would like to stay. “Normally I would say several, but magically protected books and us don’t get along,” Galen points out, to which Rydia concurs. Beck wonders how you’re supposed to know what book is what, especially considering all the books look the same. 

“It’s not worth it,” Galen says, Rydia echoing the sentiment. Galen heads towards the door, the others joining and Petr casting another Dispel Magic, which opens that door as well. Gargoyles in the library room once again turn their heads. 

As they move into the next room, Rydia catches Galen’s hand, squeezing it once. “We’ll come back here some other time, we’ll bring lots and lots of Dispel Magic,” she says. “We know it’s here and we can prepare.” Galen says it’s not worth dying over, so Rydia suggests they can bring people they don’t care about, who can open the books for them. “Right, that was the mistake last time…” 

“You’re not suddenly afraid of reading, are you?” Rydia asks him, which Galen denies. “I’m afraid of repeating all the same mistakes.” Rydia points out that if this was a common mistake to make, there would be more of her. Galen says he got sloppy, to which Rydia says he should simply get less sloppy, and not ignore what they just found. “Think about it. Make a plan. We’ll come back, safely.” 

“I’ve made so many mistakes,” Galen mutters. Rydia says there was only one mistake, and she was there with him when they made it, it wasn’t just his to make. “That wasn’t the only one,” Galen admits, before walking away, heading into the new room. 

They seem to have entered into the inside of a tower, with a high up ceiling. There’s a landing in front of them and the tower walls are filled with golden chalk drawings of moon movements and other scribbles of geometric shapes. There’s draconic writing on the walls as well, and there’s a walk way up ahead to a larger, well-lit room. This walkthrough opens up to a small balcony and from there, in the room beyond, they can see a massive pool of blood in the center of the room with a huge dawn shard in the middle. 

Bonzo’s spell doesn’t pick up on anything magical as they move further inside. As they peer through the opening of the wall, they realise that this seems like an underground cathedral. They’re on a raised balcony, with a staircase leading down. There’s another balcony up ahead, perched atop five rearing stone feathered snake faces, blood drippling from their jaws, falling into a semi circular basin connecting to the larger round basin with the dawn shard in it. To the west, there’s a large gong, carved with draconic writings. 

As they’re all taking in their surroundings, Galen and Bonzo notice a woman standing in the shadows, looking back at them. They can’t make out her face, but her silhouette is slender, lithe and graceful. “Fourth eye’s blinded by the trees,” Galen calls out to her. 

“Ah, so you’ve read the predictions of the rogue one. Interesting,” the woman says in Elvish, stepping forward into the light. She has dark skin, silvery white hair in cornrows that go up into a messy bun. She wears an exquisite looking robe, almost half translucent, wearing jewellery all made out of strange orange pieces of dragon shard. 

As none of the others speak Elvish, Beck translates what she just said. Galen tells her that it’s what led them here. “You aren’t supposed to come here. This isn’t a place you just visit,” she says, switching to Common so everyone can understand her. “Then what are we supposed to do?” Galen asks, to which the woman says she doesn’t know, as she doesn’t know who they are. “I’ve seen you enter this temple, look at my books. Who do I have the honor of meeting?” she asks, a slight tone of sarcasm to her voice.

Galen introduces himself by name, the others simply as the crew of the Heritage. She approaches them, wading through the blood in the basin, which spoils her tunic. As she exits the blood she waves her hand, the blood turning to dust and cleaning her tunic. 

As she moves even closer, the dragonmark on the back of Beck’s shoulder starts to sear with pain, burning into his skin. “Oh dear,” the woman says, stepping back a bit as she notices it. “Seems like we’re dealing with a complex group of individuals,” she points out, noting Rydia as well, studying all of them.

“We didn’t come here for a fight, or to steal anything. We just came looking for information. Maybe you can help,” Galen says. She says she can try, casting a spell with a flick of her hand. The blood in the pool starts to reach up, shooting up at the various gargoyles on the ceiling, creating a web of flowing blood around them all.

The pressure in their heads suddenly vanishes, [[Masvirik]]’s corruption leaving them all. “You can speak freely now. You were asking about the Eye, the one that the last Speaker used?” Galen asks Rydia if she wants to do the talking, who fumbles about how she thinks she can’t really explain, so she asks Galen to do the talking. 

He does, telling this woman about what happening, that the two of them found the tome of [[Vvaraak]]. “It had consequences,” he adds, to which the woman says she supposed she’s looking at the consequences. She starts to levitate, moving towards Rydia. “Fascinating…” She urges Galen to continue his story as she looks at Rydia, so Galen says Rydia kept repeating the line about the Fourth Eye, and that’s what eventually led them here. 

“[[Nerima]] suggested we could use the Eye to get some answers,” Galen then adds, to which the woman asks him if he knows what the eye is. He denies this, so she explains. “It is a piece of a much larger crystal that was used to contact the dream world of [[Dal’Quor]], once. But the properties of the crystal don’t just work for that one plane. You can contact any plane, any one, at any time, in any place.” She goes on to say it is quite powerful and they’re not quite sure where it fits with the regular dragon shards; it’s clearly a special piece of crystal. 

“Until a couple of centuries ago we used it here at [[Haka’torvak]] to maintain our connection with [[Rashaak]] until that got corrupted. By [[Masvirik]]. So it is buried with the last Speaker. If you wish to look at the crystal, I can take you to his tomb. But … I’m intrigued. You read a book, you said,” she says, looking back over at Rydia. Galen corrects her by saying they found a book. “Are you just looking for answers?” she then asks, Galen confirming that is why they came here for.

“And what question would you like answered?” Galen looks at Rydia, who simply says “Why?”. The woman asks her to specify; why did this happen to you? Why her? Rydia says it’s both, unsure of what to say before adding that she thinks there was a purpose to this. “There is always purpose to everything that happens,” the woman says. “The draconic prophecy is very clear on that. The problem is .. what purpose? And that I’m afraid is muddy. It is said that an empty vessel will reclaim the throne. I wonder if that’s you…” Both Galen and Rydia question the phrasing of that, Galen asking if she just called Rydia a queen as Rydia asks about the empty vessel. “Were you not an innocent before all this happened? Somebody getting by on the sidelines of history?” 

Rydia supposes that part has changed, before the woman asks Rydia if she’s looking to stop this. “I understand this is not aesthetically pleasing to your kind,” she adds, gesturing to Rydia. “But to ruin great potential power for something as shallow as that, would be a mistake I think.” 

Rydia says she’s not interested in power, though she does admit it helped. “I did a thing, it was … pretty amazing.” Galen tells the woman Rydia managed to bring down [[Rashaak]] on her own, to which the woman says apparently they’ll have to do something about [[Rashaak]] again. “I’ve done things,” Rydia continues. “That I … the old … I can handle what I’ve done now, but she can’t.” The woman asks if she’s talking about her old self, which Rydia confirms.

“That is maybe a sign to push forward, instead of go back.” She then offers to try something, plucking a piece of dragonshard from her gown and approaching Rydia. Rydia looks over at Galen, who asks the woman if it’s going to make anything worse. “On the contrary, I was hoping to increase her telekinetic abilities,” the woman offers. 

Galen tells her to go ahead, so she presses the piece of dragon shard near Rydia’s transformed eye. She can feel it melting with the flesh as the woman grants Rydia telekinetic powers. Galen asks Rydia if she’s okay, who confirms this before she turns around, using her newfound powers to lift Bonzo’s pistol from it’s holster. 

Objecting a little, Bonzo tells her to be careful about where she’s pointing it before grabbing it back out of the air, putting it back in his holster. “A chance to steer a prophecy in a clear direction only comes about a few times in a dragon’s life,” the woman muses as she watches the group in amusement. 

This prompts Galen to ask for her name, which she gives: [[Vyssilithar]]. As she says her name, her shoulders start to bulge out, neck growing longer as her entire form increases as she transform into an ancient amethyst dragon, floating in front of the group. Her name isn’t familiar to any of the group. 

Telepathically, she addresses the whole group. 

"My dear, I am older than the kingdom of Galifar itself;  Through my studies of the Prophecy, I posses knowledge of the past and of the possible paths of the future. I have fought rakshasas in the Demon Wastes, and gazed on the Pit of Five Sorrows. I've spent a decade as a Lhazaar princess and a century studying ruins in Xen’drik. I, Vyssilithar have knowledge that would take a mortal fourteen lifetimes to gain.

I have contacts across the world, and have negotiated with angels and argued with kings. With force of will and the sorcerous power of my blood, I can make your very wishes reality."
