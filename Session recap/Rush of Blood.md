# Rush of Blood

"My dear, I am older than the kingdom of Galifar itself;  Through my studies of the Prophecy, I posses knowledge of the past and of the possible paths of the future. I have fought rakshasas in the Demon Wastes, and gazed on the Pit of Five Sorrows. I've spent a decade as a Lhazaar princess and a century studying ruins in Xenâ€™drik. I, Vyssilithar have knowledge that would take a mortal fourteen lifetimes to gain.

I have contacts across the world, and have negotiated with angels and argued with kings. With force of will and the sorcerous power of my blood, I can make your very wishes reality."
