# Divine Blood
Everyone now notices the woman in black, her scythe gleaming in the lights around the bar. She overlooks the scene as everyone in the bar falls silent, then walks up to the bar, dropping a bloodied gold coin onto the bar. Two men walk in behind her, wearing jumpsuits like clothing with four scratch-like claw marks in a bright emerald green over their hearts. The two men walk towards the sandpit, where one of the fighters just fell. 

The crowd separates as she makes her way over, plopping down a coin on the bar before she greets the barman. "Hello Drogo, pleasure doing business with you again," she says. To Rydia and Galen, this is a familiar sight, as they recall their last encounter with this woman. Knowing Beck and Petr have also seen her but didn't seem to remember, Rydia casts Intellect Fortress on the two of them, which the woman notices. 

She looks up for a moment, giving Rydia a sly smile. Beck looks at the symbol on the suits of the men, recognising it as the symbol of the Emerald Claw. Despite not remembering the woman from before, the golden mask the woman is wearing also stands out, as Galen has warned the entire crew against people who wear such a symbol.

"So, this one looks like quite a fighter. Has he lost a lot of blood?" the woman asks Drogo, who says he's not sure as it was very busy. "Either way, we'll take him off your hands." The two men move in closer to the sandpit, starting to pick up the body of the fallen fighter.

The woman then looks over at Galen, and she offers him a sly smile as well. "Problem?" Galen asks, to which she says there's no problem, but she didn't expect to see him here. He asks her where she did expect to see him. "Oh I don't know, more civilized surroundings?" She comments on how he's picked an interesting corner of Khorvaire, calling him by his name. 

She then asks him if he's staying safe. "I just think it's very important that you stay safe," she says when Galen asks her why that matters to her. Now that he's getting a closer look at her and getting to speak to her, Galen recognises the woman's voice. He recalls Lady Vedanthe speaking to her and calling her [[Saedra]]. 

Galen asks her if she's in town for long, to which she says she's only popping in and out. The two continue to speak as the woman watches her two men pick up the body. "Until next time," she then says, running her finger along Galen's jawline before she makes her exit. Before she walks back, she looks around the bar and after she walks out, only a few of the people inside remember her even being here. 

Out of the crew, only Petr and Galen remember what just happened, the others left somewhat confused as to what they seem to have missed. Slowly, people in the bar start talking to each other again, picking up conversations where they left of and it's only because Petr and Galen comment on what just happened that the others question whether or not they just missed something. 

Galen looks to Rydia to figure out if she remembers what just happened, which she doesn't. "Karrnathies were here, just now" Galen then explains, though he's unwilling to go into it right now, suggesting they should discuss this somewhere else. "I promise I will explain everything, but not in this bar."

As Azaka is still downing drinks at the bar, Beck comments on how they probably shouldn't stay here too long. Before they leave, Rydia arranges for Drogo to deliver them some new alcohol provisions the following morning, buying a spread of alcohol for the ship. 

After they finish their drinks, the crew leaves Azaka behind as they head back towards the ship. They discuss their plans of what to do next, agreeing they'll sleep on the ship tonight, get some last supplies the following morning, send some letters and then be on their way. 

Back at the Heritage, Beck asks Galen for that explanation he promised. "You remember when you two met us?" Galen asks Beck and Petr, mentioning the bar they met in back in Gatherhold. He talks about how he and Rydia got into a fight with the Daask, a bunch of people died. "Before I really knew what was happening, the door opened and a bunch of Karrnathy soldiers walked in, along with this lady with a gold mask and a scythe." She had her men collect the bodies, left coins behind for those collected and then walked out. "And no one else could remember what happened apart from Rydia and I."

Bonzo asks if that just also happened in the bar, which Galen confirms. Petr also confirms that he does remember this happening at the bar tonight, whereas Rydia, Beck and Bonzo no longer recall this. "What did she want at the bar?" Bonzo asks, Galen saying she wanted the bodies as Beck wonders if this is a normal Karrnath thing, as they do seem to have a thing with the undead. Galen knows there are body collectors, but none of them dress up like that. He also recalls the Emerald Claw symbol, like Beck did earlier, except Beck no longer remembers this. 

"Karrnath has a thing about undead, the bodies thing is not unusual, but the thing she's coming all the way down here for this is weird. She also knew exactly who I was..." Galen goes on, Beck pointing out that the masks and the Sanguine Council does seem to connect to Galen. 

Seeing these Emerald Claw soldiers again sparks some memories for Galen. He recalls seeing these soldiers in a religious procession, together with his employer at the time, Lady Vedanthe. She explained they are a fanatic following of the Blood of Vol, a relatively common religion in Karrnath. It states that the blood of the living is sacred, that is your path to divinity. They see somebody who is undead as inherently not divine, but therefore a martyr, as they gave up their divinity to serve some purpose or another. 

Galen shares this with the others, which leaves Bonzo to wonder why they would come all the way out here. "Why at bars?" Galen points out people seem to die at bars, which the others find a somewhat questionable explanation. 

"Maybe the coins have something to do with it somehow?" Galen theorizes. Beck asks about the coins, wondering if there's something odd about them. He suggests going back for one, which is an idea Galen seems to strongly oppose to. He doesn't want them to go poking at this, to which Beck points out they seem to be poking at him plenty. 

Rydia asks if these are the people who are concerned about keeping Galen alive, which he confirms. Beck adds that's concerning to him, considering they don't know the reason they want this. "If you put it like that, now I'm curious about the coins too," Rydia says, which prompts Beck to turn around and head back to the bar, Rydia soon following him. 

They find their way back, finding a couple of regulars as well as Azaka still at the bar as Drogo is cleaning up. He recognises the two of them and greets them, Beck telling him they were curious about the coins. Azaka asks him how he knows about the second coin, Beck saying they were there and remember the coin being dropped off, which isn't true. Azaka points out most people don't remember, to which Rydia points out she's special, removing her mask. 

Beck then asks him if they can take a look at the coins, which Azaka agrees to. He puts both coins on the bar and Beck and Rydia take a closer look, though they don't note anything particularly strange about the coins. They're of Karrnathy mintage, both have blood on them, but other than that they're normal coins. 

"Could we hold on to the new one?" Beck asks, but Drogo seems somewhat reluctant to let go of the coins. Beck shares that the person who gave it to him seems to have an interest in someone of his crew, and they're looking into that. Using Detect Thoughts, Rydia picks up on Drogo being attracted to the woman, and also being amazed how Azaka is still drinking. Rydia tries to dig deeper into his thoughts, but it fails and Drogo picks up on it, instantly less reluctant to help them out.

Beck points out that he doesn't know who this woman is and that perhaps he shouldn't trust her so much, which Drogo does seem to consider. They eventually manage to talk Drogo into letting them borrow the coin for the night, so they leave the bar again and head back to the ship with the coin in hand. 

As they reach the deck again, Beck holds up the coin to the others. Galen asks them what they think they're doing and why they have the coin, Beck pointing out he thinks it's a lead and something they should look into. Bonzo offers to take a look at the coin, casting Identify on it. He sees images of eyes and ears, the ceiling of the bar, all of that tells him there's some divination magic, though it doesn't come from the coin. It comes from the blood on it. He thinks it's a way of keeping tabs on people, similar to a Scrying sensor. 

He shares this with the others, which makes Galen even less pleased about them having the coin. Bonzo also suggests that they return it, as Beck asks Petr and Galen if they saw her touch the coin to the body they collected. They didn't see, so Beck suggests it could've been her blood. 

"Bonzo, can you do that again?" Galen then asks, before grabbing a coin, cutting his hand, bleeding on it and handing it to Bonzo. Rydia points out she was planning on licking the blood, but this seems like a much better plan. 

Bonzo identifies the coin with Galen's blood on it, finding Galen's blood is magical too. He sees images of an ruined jungle city,  shattering dragon shards, familiar barracks from back in Haka'torvak. There's a necromantic energy to it. He realises that he's seeing images from the perspective of what's likely a black scale that they killed back in that city. 

"This was a totally different experience from the other coin, your blood is also magical," he tells Galen, describing what he saw and what he thinks it was. "But they're not watching me?" Galen asks, which Bonzo confirms, though everything else about it is still weird. 

Bonzo suggests that maybe they should go to Haka'torvak to figure this out, though Galen is quick to say the problem isn't there. They try to discuss what they can do about this, Beck saying they should look into this. "Where do we begin?" None of them really know, though there's the joking suggestion of them starting a bar fight and killing someone, which is quickly dismissed. 

"Whatever is going on with me, is not important. What's important is getting to Sharn, figuring out what's up with the Eyes and finding this guy who can help is figure out what we're dealing with" Galen says, Rydia promptly slapping him. "Let's consider those things of equal importance, shall we?" she says. 

Beck says he wants to hold on to the coin, as it's one of their very few leads. He adds they can put it in the doorknob. "I know it sounds like a bad idea right now, but if in the future we can somehow use the coin to get to the lady, it might be useful" he adds, Rydia and Petr agreeing that they can give Drogo a fake coin. Beck puts the coin away inside some fabric and then they all sift through their pockets, eventually finding a Karrnathy coin that Galen puts some blood on. 

To be sure, Beck casts Dispel Magic on Galen's blood. As he does, a blue cloud of ectoplasm rises from the blood. With all that discussed and taken care of, they all get ready for bed. 

Rydia and Beck take the first watch. Beck asks Rydia if Galen has always been so self-deprecating, as he seems very adament about his problems being less important than others. Rydia says it seems to be some sort of consequence of what happened to them. "He blames himself for what happened. I think he thinks he's less deserving of help than I am, because he somehow caused all this."

Beck points out they all agreed to be there, Rydia saying that she's the one who touched the book. "I touched it. I did the bad things, not him." Beck adds that it's difficult to be the one who survived something when others didn't get so lucky. "Doesn't sound to me like either of you is to blame," he adds. Rydia thanks him, saying it feels like they're a group again. 

"Have to admit I'm a little bit ... last time it didn't... things happened and I would like it if they didn't happen again," Rydia points out, Beck saying they should definitely try to make sure they don't. 

With their watch coming to an end, Beck goes to wake Bonzo, who joins Rydia for the second watch. 

Meanwhile, Galen dreams. He finds himself shivering. He can't see anything through the thick canvas bag over his head and his feet and his arms are bound by metal. Through the canvas he can make out sources of torch light and he starts to hear voices.

"Is it done, Lady Vedanthe?" the voice asks. Lady Vedanthe confirms this. "I think we're ready, Saedra." He gets pushed forward, bare feet on cold tiles as he moves forward. The torchlight seems to come closer and he can hear the chains rattling from people behind him, hearing breathing as well as whimpered cries. 

He gets stopped, Lady Vedanthe's voice saying: "Now, let's see if this works." There's a rush of light as the bag is pulled from his head and he can see he's in the middle of some sort of temple complex. In the center of the area there's an altar and around him there's a pool of mixed blood. 

He can see two women, Lady Vedanthe and Saedra, both wearing gowns that seem to be made out of liquid blood. Saedra's mask is on top of her head as she approaches him with a golden dagger in hand. "Do you have any last words before you become part of this great experiment?"

Galen speaks, saying "I'm not gonna let you get away with this," but the voice coming out of his mouth is not Galen's voice. As he peers over her shoulder, he can see a body, strapped to the altar, that he recognises as his own body. Saedra plunges the dagger into his throat and he can feel his sense of self leaving the body he's in now, slowly drifting in this space before shooting into the sternum of Galen d'Arcy.

With that, Galen awakes with a start, covered in sweat. 

Back atop the deck of the ship, Bonzo and Rydia keep an eye out during their second watch. Bonzo tells Rydia that he's still considering the request she posed not long ago. He's had some more time to think about it now, and he's not sure if he should do what she asked, but he does want to help. "Like I said when we were leaving Haka'torvak; I don't want to hurt people. Especially not the people that I care for." He doesn't want one of his creations to potentially put her in danger.

"I could maybe think of different options that are a bit more pacifist," he offers, saying he wanted to run that by her first. Rydia says she appreciates that he doesn't want to hurt her. "I feel like after everything we've learned, barring my little condition when I tried to figure out if Galen was alive, for the first time I feel like there's some grander reason to everything" she adds, saying that really helps her. 

She goes on to say that she also still knows what can happen if she's not the way she is right now, and she also doesn't want to hurt people that she cares about. "I'd like it if, should that become a problem, we could help me to not do that. If you can find a way to do that without hurting me, that would be ..."

Bonzo says he thinks he can think of ways to temporarily stop her so they can get people to safety without hurting her, but it might take him a little while. He also points out that whatever he comes up with will likely be some sort of item that she has to carry, and Galen will probably notice her wearing that. He doesn't think Galen would like it if he found out he worked on this, or that she requested him to make something.

"I'll have a conversation with Galen," Rydia says, saying he'd probably like it even less if the item turned out to be necessary and it wasn't there. "I think he would appreciate it being there." Bonzo says he's open for discussing plans as to how they can convince Galen that this is a good thing. "But I'll leave that up to you."

They decide to think on it and not ask Galen anything right now. The rest of their watch goes by quietly, Bonzo then heading below deck to wake Petr as Rydia goes to join Galen in their room. She finds him awake, Galen having found himself unable to go back to sleep after waking from his dream. 

He doesn't mention the dream, instead just pulling Rydia in closer as she cuddles up to him in the bed. 

Petr takes the third watch, finding him way atop the deck. He doesn't notice too many things out of the ordinary, except for a single man who's standing out on one of the piers, peering out into Adder Bay with a looking glass. 

The following morning, Galen finds himself still a little shaken from his dream, not having gotten a proper rest that night. They gather for breakfast, before Drogo appears with the drinks that Rydia ordered the night before. They give him the 'fake' coin back and Petr lowers the ship so that they can bring the casket of ale and other drinks aboard. 

Rydia, Galen and Bonzo then head into town to check out the post office and send some letters of their own as Petr and Beck remain aboard the ship.
