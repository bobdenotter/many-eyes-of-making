# Divine Blood
Everyone now notices the woman in black, her scythe gleaming in the lights around the bar. She overlooks the scene as everyone in the bar falls silent, then walks up to the bar, dropping a bloodied gold coin onto the bar. Two men walk in behind her, wearing jumpsuits like clothing with four scratch-like claw marks in a bright emerald green over their hearts. The two men walk towards the sandpit, where one of the fighters just fell. 

The crowd separates as she makes her way over, plopping down a coin on the bar before she greets the barman. "Hello Drogo, pleasure doing business with you again," she says. To Rydia and Galen, this is a familiar sight, as they recall their last encounter with this woman. Knowing Beck and Petr have also seen her but didn't seem to remember, Rydia casts Intellect Fortress on the two of them, which the woman notices. 

She looks up for a moment, giving Rydia a sly smile. Beck looks at the symbol on the suits of the men, recognising it as the symbol of the Emerald Claw. Despite not remembering the woman from before, the golden mask the woman is wearing also stands out, as Galen has warned the entire crew against people who wear such a symbol.

"So, this one looks like quite a fighter. Has he lost a lot of blood?" the woman asks Drogo, who says he's not sure as it was very busy. "Either way, we'll take him off your hands." The two men move in closer to the sandpit, starting to pick up the body of the fallen fighter.

The woman then looks over at Galen, and she offers him a sly smile as well. "Problem?" Galen asks, to which she says there's no problem, but she didn't expect to see him here. He asks her where she did expect to see him. "Oh I don't know, more civilized surroundings?" She comments on how he's picked an interesting corner of Khorvaire, calling him by his name. 

She then asks him if he's staying safe. "I just think it's very important that you stay safe," she says when Galen asks her why that matters to her. Now that he's getting a closer look at her and getting to speak to her, Galen recognises the woman's voice. He recalls Lady Vidante speaking to her and calling her [[Saedra]]. 

Galen asks her if she's in town for long, to which she says she's only popping in and out. The two continue to speak as the woman watches her two men pick up the body. "Until next time," she then says, running her finger along Galen's jawline before she makes her exit. Before she walks back, she looks around the bar and after she walks out, only a few of the people inside remember her even being here. 

Out of the crew, only Petr and Galen remember what just happened, the others left somewhat confused as to what they seem to have missed. Slowly, people in the bar start talking to each other again, picking up conversations where they left off and it's only because Petr and Galen comment on what just happened that the others question whether or not they just missed something. 

Galen looks to Rydia to figure out if she remembers what just happened, which she doesn't. "Karrnathies were here, just now" Galen then explains, though he's unwilling to go into it right now, suggesting they should discuss this somewhere else. "I promise I will explain everything, but not in this bar."

As Azaka is still downing drinks at the bar, Beck comments on how they probably shouldn't stay here too long. Before they leave, Rydia arranges for Drogo to deliver them some new alcohol provisions the following morning, buying a spread of alcohol for the ship. 

After they finish their drinks, the crew leaves Azaka behind as they head back towards the ship. They discuss their plans of what to do next, agreeing they'll sleep on the ship tonight, get some last supplies the following morning, send some letters and then be on their way. 

Back at the Heritage, Beck asks Galen for that explanation he promised. "You remember when you two met us?" Galen asks Beck and Petr, mentioning the bar they met in back in Gatherhold. He talks about how he and Rydia got into a fight with the Daask, a bunch of people died. "Before I really knew what was happening, the door opened and a bunch of Karrnathi soldiers walked in, along with this lady with a gold mask and a scythe." She had her men collect the bodies, left coins behind for those collected and then walked out. "And no one else could remember what happened apart from Rydia and I."

Bonzo asks if that just also happened in the bar, which Galen confirms. Petr also confirms that he does remember this happening at the bar tonight, whereas Rydia, Beck and Bonzo no longer recall this. "What did she want at the bar?" Bonzo asks, Galen saying she wanted the bodies as Beck wonders if this is a normal Karrnath thing, as they do seem to have a thing with the undead. Galen knows there are body collectors, but none of them dress up like that. He also recalls the Emerald Claw symbol, like Beck did earlier, except Beck no longer remembers this. 

"Karrnath has a thing about undead, the bodies thing is not unusual, but the thing she's coming all the way down here for this is weird. She also knew exactly who I was..." Galen goes on, Beck pointing out that the masks and the Sanguine Council does seem to connect to Galen. 

Seeing these Emerald Claw soldiers again sparks some memories for Galen. He recalls seeing these soldiers in a religious procession, together with his employer at the time, Lady Vidante. She explained they are a fanatic following of the Blood of Vol, a relatively common religion in Karrnath. It states that the blood of the living is sacred, that is your path to divinity. They see somebody who is undead as inherently not divine, but therefore a martyr, as they gave up their divinity to serve some purpose or another. 

Galen shares this with the others, which leaves Bonzo to wonder why they would come all the way out here. "Why at bars?" Galen points out people seem to die at bars, which the others find a somewhat questionable explanation. 

"Maybe the coins have something to do with it somehow?" Galen theorizes. Beck asks about the coins, wondering if there's something odd about them. He suggests going back for one, which is an idea Galen seems to strongly oppose to. He doesn't want them to go poking at this, to which Beck points out they seem to be poking at him plenty. 

Rydia asks if these are the people who are concerned about keeping Galen alive, which he confirms. Beck adds that's concerning to him, considering they don't know the reason they want this. "If you put it like that, now I'm curious about the coins too," Rydia says, which prompts Beck to turn around and head back to the bar, Rydia soon following him. 

They find their way back, finding a couple of regulars as well as Azaka still at the bar as Drogo is cleaning up. He recognises the two of them and greets them, Beck telling him they were curious about the coins. Azaka asks him how he knows about the second coin, Beck saying they were there and remember the coin being dropped off, which isn't true. Azaka points out most people don't remember, to which Rydia points out she's special, removing her mask. 

Beck then asks him if they can take a look at the coins, which Azaka agrees to. He puts both coins on the bar and Beck and Rydia take a closer look, though they don't note anything particularly strange about the coins. They're of Karrnathi mintage, both have blood on them, but other than that they're normal coins. 

"Could we hold on to the new one?" Beck asks, but Drogo seems somewhat reluctant to let go of the coins. Beck shares that the person who gave it to him seems to have an interest in someone of his crew, and they're looking into that. Using Detect Thoughts, Rydia picks up on Drogo being attracted to the woman, and also being amazed how Azaka is still drinking. Rydia tries to dig deeper into his thoughts, but it fails and Drogo picks up on it, instantly less reluctant to help them out.

Beck points out that he doesn't know who this woman is and that perhaps he shouldn't trust her so much, which Drogo does seem to consider. They eventually manage to talk Drogo into letting them borrow the coin for the night, so they leave the bar again and head back to the ship with the coin in hand. 

As they reach the deck again, Beck holds up the coin to the others. Galen asks them what they think they're doing and why they have the coin, Beck pointing out he thinks it's a lead and something they should look into. Bonzo offers to take a look at the coin, casting Identify on it. He sees images of eyes and ears, the ceiling of the bar, all of that tells him there's some divination magic, though it doesn't come from the coin. It comes from the blood on it. He thinks it's a way of keeping tabs on people, similar to a Scrying sensor. 

He shares this with the others, which makes Galen even less pleased about them having the coin. Bonzo also suggests that they return it, as Beck asks Petr and Galen if they saw her touch the coin to the body they collected. They didn't see, so Beck suggests it could've been her blood. 

"Bonzo, can you do that again?" Galen then asks, before grabbing a coin, cutting his hand, bleeding on it and handing it to Bonzo. Rydia points out she was planning on licking the blood, but this seems like a much better plan. 

Bonzo identifies the coin with Galen's blood on it, finding Galen's blood is magical too. He sees images of an ruined jungle city,  shattering dragon shards, familiar barracks from back in Haka'torvak. There's a necromantic energy to it. He realises that he's seeing images from the perspective of what's likely a black scale that they killed back in that city. 

"This was a totally different experience from the other coin, your blood is also magical," he tells Galen, describing what he saw and what he thinks it was. "But they're not watching me?" Galen asks, which Bonzo confirms, though everything else about it is still weird. 

Bonzo suggests that maybe they should go to Haka'torvak to figure this out, though Galen is quick to say the problem isn't there. They try to discuss what they can do about this, Beck saying they should look into this. "Where do we begin?" None of them really know, though there's the joking suggestion of them starting a bar fight and killing someone, which is quickly dismissed. 

"Whatever is going on with me, is not important. What's important is getting to Sharn, figuring out what's up with the Eyes and finding this guy who can help is figure out what we're dealing with" Galen says, Rydia promptly slapping him. "Let's consider those things of equal importance, shall we?" she says. 

Beck says he wants to hold on to the coin, as it's one of their very few leads. He adds they can put it in the doorknob. "I know it sounds like a bad idea right now, but if in the future we can somehow use the coin to get to the lady, it might be useful" he adds, Rydia and Petr agreeing that they can give Drogo a fake coin. Beck puts the coin away inside some fabric and then they all sift through their pockets, eventually finding a Karrnathi coin that Galen puts some blood on. 

To be sure, Beck casts Dispel Magic on Galen's blood. As he does, a blue cloud of ectoplasm rises from the blood. With all that discussed and taken care of, they all get ready for bed. 

Rydia and Beck take the first watch. Beck asks Rydia if Galen has always been so self-deprecating, as he seems very adament about his problems being less important than others. Rydia says it seems to be some sort of consequence of what happened to them. "He blames himself for what happened. I think he thinks he's less deserving of help than I am, because he somehow caused all this."

Beck points out they all agreed to be there, Rydia saying that she's the one who touched the book. "I touched it. I did the bad things, not him." Beck adds that it's difficult to be the one who survived something when others didn't get so lucky. "Doesn't sound to me like either of you is to blame," he adds. Rydia thanks him, saying it feels like they're a group again. 

"Have to admit I'm a little bit ... last time it didn't... things happened and I would like it if they didn't happen again," Rydia points out, Beck saying they should definitely try to make sure they don't. 

With their watch coming to an end, Beck goes to wake Bonzo, who joins Rydia for the second watch. 

Meanwhile, Galen dreams. He finds himself shivering. He can't see anything through the thick canvas bag over his head and his feet and his arms are bound by metal. Through the canvas he can make out sources of torch light and he starts to hear voices.

"Is it done, Lady Vidante?" the voice asks. Lady Vidante confirms this. "I think we're ready, Saedra." He gets pushed forward, bare feet on cold tiles as he moves forward. The torchlight seems to come closer and he can hear the chains rattling from people behind him, hearing breathing as well as whimpered cries. 

He gets stopped, Lady Vidante's voice saying: "Now, let's see if this works." There's a rush of light as the bag is pulled from his head and he can see he's in the middle of some sort of temple complex. In the center of the area there's an altar and around him there's a pool of mixed blood. 

He can see two women, Lady Vidante and Saedra, both wearing gowns that seem to be made out of liquid blood. Saedra's mask is on top of her head as she approaches him with a golden dagger in hand. "Do you have any last words before you become part of this great experiment?"

Galen speaks, saying "I'm not gonna let you get away with this," but the voice coming out of his mouth is not Galen's voice. As he peers over her shoulder, he can see a body, strapped to the altar, that he recognises as his own body. Saedra plunges the dagger into his throat and he can feel his sense of self leaving the body he's in now, slowly drifting in this space before shooting into the sternum of Galen d'Arcy.

With that, Galen awakes with a start, covered in sweat. 

Back atop the deck of the ship, Bonzo and Rydia keep an eye out during their second watch. Bonzo tells Rydia that he's still considering the request she posed not long ago. He's had some more time to think about it now, and he's not sure if he should do what she asked, but he does want to help. "Like I said when we were leaving Haka'torvak; I don't want to hurt people. Especially not the people that I care for." He doesn't want one of his creations to potentially put her in danger.

"I could maybe think of different options that are a bit more pacifist," he offers, saying he wanted to run that by her first. Rydia says she appreciates that he doesn't want to hurt her. "I feel like after everything we've learned, barring my little condition when I tried to figure out if Galen was alive, for the first time I feel like there's some grander reason to everything" she adds, saying that really helps her. 

She goes on to say that she also still knows what can happen if she's not the way she is right now, and she also doesn't want to hurt people that she cares about. "I'd like it if, should that become a problem, we could help me to not do that. If you can find a way to do that without hurting me, that would be ..."

Bonzo says he thinks he can think of ways to temporarily stop her so they can get people to safety without hurting her, but it might take him a little while. He also points out that whatever he comes up with will likely be some sort of item that she has to carry, and Galen will probably notice her wearing that. He doesn't think Galen would like it if he found out he worked on this, or that she requested him to make something.

"I'll have a conversation with Galen," Rydia says, saying he'd probably like it even less if the item turned out to be necessary and it wasn't there. "I think he would appreciate it being there." Bonzo says he's open for discussing plans as to how they can convince Galen that this is a good thing. "But I'll leave that up to you."

They decide to think on it and not ask Galen anything right now. The rest of their watch goes by quietly, Bonzo then heading below deck to wake Petr as Rydia goes to join Galen in their room. She finds him awake, Galen having found himself unable to go back to sleep after waking from his dream. 

He doesn't mention the dream, instead just pulling Rydia in closer as she cuddles up to him in the bed. 

Petr takes the third watch, finding him way atop the deck. He doesn't notice too many things out of the ordinary, except for a single man who's standing out on one of the piers, peering out into Adder Bay with a looking glass. 

The following morning, Galen finds himself still a little shaken from his dream, not having gotten a proper rest that night. They gather for breakfast, before Drogo appears with the drinks that Rydia ordered the night before. They give him the 'fake' coin back and Petr lowers the ship so that they can bring the casket of ale and other drinks aboard. 

Rydia, Galen and Bonzo then head into town to check out the post office and send some letters of their own as Petr and Beck remain aboard the ship. 

At the post office, Rydia, Galen as well as Bonzo have some letters. Rydia has one from her family, of which the general gist is that they want her to be safe. Galen has a note from his father, thanking him for his help with the family business. Bonzo has a response from the [[Architects]]. 

Galen sends a letter to both Daphne and Esme, telling them he'll be in Sharn soon (telling Esme what port he thinks they'll be landing at and sharing the name of the ship with her as well) and Bonzo sends off some letters as well, one to his mother, one to his father (who he believes is still in Sharn), and one back to the Architects. 

On the way back, Galen picks up a Healer's kit. 

As they're waiting on the others to return, Beck checks in with Petr, curious if he's heard anything from the Gatekeepers. Petr admits that he hasn't, but he also hasn't really let them know anything himself. They discuss whether or not to keep them in the loop, Beck suggesting that it wouldn't hurt if they tell them that they still think Rydia isn't acting suspicious in any way. "Whilst I don't doubt the good intentions of the Gatekeepers, I don't think they're correct in their assessment of Rydia," Petr says.

Beck wonders if they might find other ways to check up on Rydia if Petr doesn't keep them involved, so Petr says he'll send them a message sometime soon. "I'm going to make sure I don't say things that aren't true, but I'll make sure to paint Rydia in a positive light."

Petr uses his Animal Messenger spell to summon said animal messenger, relaying this message to the parrot that shows up and sending it on its way. He then says that was a good idea, commenting on how that's probably why they made Beck captain. As Beck points out he still feels weird sleeping in the captain's quarters, the two of them agree to check in on Fianin sometime soon. "Let's not mention the fact that the ship keeps getting partially destroyed..."

The man that Petr noticed on the docks before is still there, seemingly still looking out into the bay, waiting for something. Petr points him out to Beck, who looks out onto the bay to try and see if he can spot what the man is looking for. Petr theorizes what the man might be doing, then decides to head on over to go and find out. 

He finds a spyglass aboard the ship and joins the man on the pier, standing beside him as he pulls out the spyglass, looking in the same direction. "So, have you spotted it yet?" he asks after a few minutes, the man saying he hasn't, though he's not sure what Petr means. 

When asked what he's looking for, the man says it's a matter of life and death. "I'm looking for a single ship. The Emperor of the Waves," the man explains, adding that the ship was due for port a couple of months ago and it still hasn't arrived. Petr points out it must be heartbreaking, that he's still waiting after all that time.

The man shares that the ship was coming from Sharn, then asks if they came in on the airship. Petr confirms this, then suggests they can give the man a ride back to Sharn, as that is where they're going anyway. The man says that the departure from Sharn apparently went fine, but no one returned back here. "I'm afraid that going back to Sharn would mean that I would be living in the slums of Lower Dura."

He then asks if they saw a ship when they came flying in, which Petr didn't, but he offers they can go ask his captain. The man appreciates the offer, then introduces himself as [[Saan Aubreck]]. Petr introduces himself in turn, shaking Saan's hand. He then leads him up to the ship, where the two of them find Beck and ask him if he saw a ship.

Having seen a ship adrift on the way into Q'barra, Beck tells Saan and Petr as much. He describes the ship he saw when they flew in, which Saan says does match the description of the Emperor. "I've heard rumors of other sailors coming into the bay having seen a ship like that, I just have no idea why it would stop there. I need that ship to dock," he says, and when asked he says that everything he owns is on that ship. 

He seems to be telling the truth, though Beck feels like he's not quite telling them everything. Realising that where the ship was seen is somewhat on their way to Sharn, Beck and Petr suggest they could maybe fly by it on their way back, though they want to run it by the rest of the crew before deciding that. 

Saan says he would be very grateful for that, mentioning payment and reward, as well as people he knows in Sharn that he could maybe talk to and who he could maybe introduce them to. 

Conveniently, right about that time the others make their way back to the airship. Petr and Beck quickly explain who Saan is and what they've been discussing and as he's introduced, Galen recognises the name Albreck. He's never met Saan personally, but he's heard the name. Saan Albreck is part of the same concord in the Aurum that Beck's father is a part of. He's a very wealthy Brelish industrialist, but he seems to be very down in the dumps currently. 

"Aren't you from Sharn? What're you doing all the way up here?" Galen asks him. Saan explains he was growing tired of the city and he decided to invest heavily in Newthrone, Q'barra and the possibilities of natural minerals here. "But it doesn't seem to have worked out .." Galen points out, prompting Saan to explain more.

He purchased claims from King Sebastis, but all his paperwork is on the ship and without those papers he can't prove any of the land here is his. He hired a crew himself to transport thing as opposed to trusting House Sivis, which he now regrets. Galen asks him why he doesn't just go back to Sharn, to which Saan says that he has nothing there anymore, as he sold everything he owns for a fresh start here.

"I've been trying to hire a crew since forever, but nobody wishes to work on the promise of money" Saan says, after which Galen turns to Beck, asking if he's wanting to take a look at this. Beck says he did intend on doing that, unless anyone has any strong objections. Rydia offers Saan some breakfast, and then Galen introduces himself to Saan, who recognises his last name. "Of Beren d'Arcy?" he asks, which Galen confirms. 

Saan goes on to say that the pay he was offering people was 10% of his worldly wealth, Beck deducing that how much that will amount to might have to do with how many papers they'll be able to retrieve. "That is correct." There's also some personal effects that he wouldn't mind retrieving, but Beck tells him they'll just have to wait and see what they find, less interested in payment, especially cos it's already on their way anyway. 

They discuss some other practicalities when it comes to Saan joining them on their way there, Saan agreeing to join and saying he'll figure out a way back to Newthrone if they can just drop him off somewhere. With that all agreed, they head out, travelling for a little over a day until they get to where Beck last say the ship.

En route, they get to know Saan a little better. He was mainly tied up in iron and steel working businesses back in Sharn, owning a lot of forges below Sharn. He was part of some of the weaponry that was created by Breland during the way, but was also involved in domestic building materials. He seems very humbled by this experience and what has happened and Galen knows he wasn't always this humble before. 

Though it's foggy out, Galen and Beck manage to spot the Emperor regardless, pointing it out to the others. Saan confirms that it does indeed look like the Emperor. They move the ship a little closer, Beck using Clairvoyance to see if he can spot anything below deck on the ship. 

As they get closer to the ship, they see it's somewhat damaged. Two of it's mast seem to have been sawn off. There's no debris on the upper deck, but something seems to have been almost toying with the ship. Pieces of debris are floating around it and they can see the figurehead is missing. 

Through his spell, Beck can see beneath the deck. A bit of light comes in through the grate on the upper deck, illuminating a wooden walkway that seems to be right above the hold. There's a hatch that's leading further down into the ship. There's water dripping and slushing around in the hallway and as he looks around, Beck spots some black/purple secretion clinging to the walls. 

In it, he can see various small little bubbles that almost seem to be looking back at him. He recognises this from before and shares it with the others. 

"That sounds like way too much of a coincidence" Petr points out, Beck turning to Saan to ask if he's somehow familiar with any of this. He claims he has no idea what this is. Galen points out they're going to have to go down there anyway, taking the lead after Petr moves the ship further down. 

Leaving Saan Albreck back on the ship, they all board the Emperor and start looking around. Before they go, he does tell them where they can find things, pointing out all of it should be down in the hold, in an ornate box of sorts. 

Bonzo takes a look at the masts, trying to figure out if they really were sawn off. He's fairly certain no saw was used; the cuts don't look clean enough. The ship's masts seem to have been broken off; splinters are sticking out of the wood and there's barnacles on the wood that's left behind. "There's not usually barnacles on the top of a ship..." Bonzo points out, which the others agree does seem odd.

Meanwhile, Galen tries to open the grate to below deck, managing to pick the padlock that's keeping it shut. From atop the deck, Beck casts Detect Thoughts, the spell picking up on multiple brain waves from all around. They don't seem to be coming from the black/purple goop all around. 

He alerts the others to this, after which Galen drops down to the floor below, Petr soon following, the two of them attempting to be quiet and mostly succeeding. Before heading to the hold below, Galen checks a door to the side, listening to see if he can hear anything. He can hear a rhythmic thudding sound, as if two things are bumping into each other because of the waves.

Taking a peek inside, he sees that the floor of that chamber is completely covered in the purple goop, except for a few random spots that have sigils carved into the wood that the goop is staying away from. It's on the walls and the ceiling as well, dripping down and in the corner of the room there's three cocoons, hanging from the ceiling. 

Galen quickly closes the door again, turning to Petr and putting a finger to his mouth, telling him to be quiet. They then check the hatch that leads down, Galen quietly opening it up. He can see there's dark, muddy sea water in the hold, sloshing against old and molding crates that seem to all be piled up against the ship's port hole. 

Both Galen and Petr drop down to this level of the ship. As Petr drops down, less quietly than before, all of them suddenly feel watched, like something was just alerted to their presence. It doesn't sit well with any of them. Nothing else happens in that moment, so Petr and Galen start looking around for Saan's belongings, actually managing to spot the ornate box he described to them with relative ease.

It's quite a heavy box, so they start hauling it towards the hatch back up, which is easier said than done. Together, Petr and Galen manage to get it there, but right as he looks up to Rydia for help, Galen hears whispers echoing in his mind and freezes up, seemingly from out of nowhere. 

At that point, everyone can heard a sharp, loud ringing sound...
