# Paper Tigers
**

Detouring by some large trees so they can put the very illegal flower safely into Lux’s doorknob storage, the crew then heads back to their boat and finds their way back to the docks. This particular area of the city is filled with rough and tumble folk, and they’re met with the scent of fish as they disembark from their boats.

Looking around, Rydia notices how some broken looking warforged are unloading cargo from a ship, Lux, Bonzo and Galen instead noticing a very nicely dressed half-elf. Lux and Bonzo also notice the dragonmark on his forehead, similar to the one they saw on Esme. He seems to be locked in a heated discussion with a burly looking human man and a young half-elven woman. 

Galen recognises him as Calynden d’Lyrander, the Viceroy of the Ports. He has a similar function to Esme, though Galen knows that the two don’t like each other, Calynden thinking that someone young like Esme shouldn’t have gotten the function that he wanted. Curious, the crew discussed whether to sneak closer to see if they can hear what the discussion is about, but though Galen manages to do so unnoticed, he’s unable to pick up much of a conversation.

They try to figure out where to go next, Rydia messaging Lina to ask where she wants them to bring the orchid to. Lina tells them to go to Middle Menthis, to the Everbright Spire, where they are to ask for Thelos. Galen knows where this is; it’s near the university, so after looking around for a little while the crew finds a skycoach and they’re soon on their way to this spire.

Getting out of the skycoach, they’re met with the sight of a large white marble tower, with a domed top. Heading inside, they’re told that they can find the Exalted Order at the top floor and they’re led inside an elevator that takes them all the way to the top. As they exit, they find themselves inside a large spherical room, with close to thirty doors. There’s a floating golden orb in the center of the room, with twelve smaller globes circling around it, seemingly representing Eberron’s moons. 

They take a moment to inspect the doors, Bonzo recognising arcane symbols as well as symbols of planes and moons on the doors, though none of that helps them narrow down where they might find Thelos.

Petr then shares a foolproof method to get people to come out - if you touch something you’re not supposed to touch, someone’s bound to come yell at you. He demonstrates, leaning against one of the orbs and lo and behold, one of the door opens and a somewhat angry halfing woman emerges. 

They explain to her why they’re here and she calls out for Thelos, who soon walks out of one of the doors. He’s an elder elf, mostly bald, wearing blue and silver. The halfling walks back out, but before she gets to the door she came out of, Rydia uses her telekinesis to spin the orbs once more.

Thelos floats down, apologising for Gerda, the halfling’s, temper. The crew tell him why they’re here and who sent them, after which he leads them to a door. He speaks a word and the door opens it; beyond it, they find what looks to be a rather messy work room. There’s thin glass vials everywhere and when Lux says she’ll need some room to open the door, Thelos unceremoniously clears out a desk and makes room for her. 

She pulls out the orchid from the doorknob and hands it to Thelos, who explains that they need it as a spell component for a spell that is similar to the Water Breathing spell. The crew also informs Thelos of how they were unable to find this at the apothecary and why, to which Thelos says he’ll check in with the store owner, as he doesn’t want him to be in trouble with anyone. 

Galen asks if anyone else would know of a spell like the one Thelos is working on, Lux asking if there’s any reason why the Daask would also be interested in this flower. Thelos says he’s the one creating this spell, and he thinks it’s unlikely the Daask will be working on something similar, but the crew remains convinced it seems somewhat too big of a coincidence. 

Lux then also asks if Thelos is familiar with magic being affected by the wetlands, explaining what happened when she tried to cast Shocking Grasp. Thelos is unfamiliar, admitting he’s not the kind of person who goes out into the field a lot. She then also asks if Thelos would know of any way to better protect the doorknob, which he does say he has some ideas about. 

Considering they delivered what they were supposed to get, the crew then excuses themselves. Before they get back in the elevator, Lux tries casting Shocking Grasp again, and once again it freezes instead of creating electricity. Having noticed this, Galen asks her about this in the elevator down, Lux explaining that her magic’s been acting strange. After attempting to cast Mage Hand and that going as well as ever, she adds that it only seems to be the magic related to her dragonmark. 

Not sure what to do with that information and with the day having moved into close to dinner time, the group then splits up. Rydia and Galen head out to dinner with Galen’s parents as Bonzo, Lux and Petr head down to the Tooth and Nail bar they were asked to go to. 

This part of the city is different from the ones they’ve been in before; not quite as fancy as the upper part and not quite as grimy as the lower part, but somewhere inbetween. It seems to be a place that welcomes new travellers, with creatures from all walks of life and all races walking the streets. 

As they’re traversing down, Petr points out where he used to live, before leading the others to what looks to be a massive crevasse that turns out to be a large market. A large walkway around a tower is filled with bars and inns, illusionary magic advertising all sorts of things, including sporting events. One of the bars there is the Tooth & Nail. 

Grimy windows show a warm light within as the group heads inside, finding the bar quiet at this time of night. There’s only a few patrons, all of whom are shifters. The bar is decorated with rustic, unworked wood and unlike most of what they’ve seen of Sharn, seems to prefer candle light over magical light. 

They head to the bar and order some drinks from the ratty looking bartender and they’re about to get a table when a door opens to the side and a familiar figure walks out. A woman steps out, wiping her talons on a towel and she instantly recognises the group. She addresses both them and the bartender, seemingly glad that the group showed up, telling the bartender that she told him they would.

She offers to pay for their drinks, mentioning the reward she spoke of in the note and curious, the group asks her why she did what she did. She explains that she wanted the attention of the powers that be, specifically that of a councellor named Sonen Census(?). He runs one of the middle wards and apparently has a vendetta against shifters. He thinks all of them are lycanthropes and he and the faith he’s part of, the Silver Flame, want to kill all lycanthropes.

He was supposed to be the one to reveal the dragonshard she stole the following day; it just came in from Xendrik. Now he won’t have anything to reveal. 

The conversation then turns to her reward; she starts digging through her bag and pulls out two items. One is a bamboo tube and the other is a ring seemingly coated with fur on the inside. Taking a look, Bonzo is quick to deduce that the ring is a Ring of Warmth, and the bamboo tube contains a spell scroll for Conjure Animals. 

They exchange these items right when an old lady walks into the bar. She’s a halfling, with long brains decorated with flowers and a very prominent mustache. She turns out to be Petr’s old neighbor, a woman named Miss Azelia. The two of them briefly catch up, Petr asking if she still sells ‘flowers’, to which Azelia admits she trades in information these days, as that’s much more valuable and profitable.

She eventually excuses herself after having caught up with Petr for a moment, which leads to Petr telling Bonzo and Lux that there’s a few people in town here that he’d rather not run into again. He was involved in some illicit business before and that led to him having a debt; a debt he’s since paid of, but he’d still prefer to be careful and not run into these people again. 

They talk about this for a moment longer, before ordering food and having dinner. As they’re having dinner, they watch as Nova, the shifter who stole the crystal, goes around the bar, showing said crystal to all the patrons, clearly proud of what she did. Feeling not necessarily unwelcome, but a little bit out of the ordinary here in this bar full of shifters, Petr, Bonzo and Lux soon decide to take their leave, exiting the bar.

As they get outside, the streets have grown much more crowded, large groups of people traversing the different leveled streets of Sharn. In the crowds they spot a large behemoth, what looks to be a stone dinosaur, with a halfling riding it. Petr recalls this from stories, fairly certain that this is Sumac Boromar. 

Bonzo spots something else too; a dark clad elven figure, seemingly following behind this Boromar figure at a pace. He notes a rifle sticking out from under their cloak. Realising something is wrong, Bonzo calls out that there’s an assassin in the crowd, which leads to some confusion in the people around them, but the Boromar figure can’t hear him. Petr pulls back a little, unwilling to get too involved, pointing out that the Boromar clan are the ones he was in trouble with before.

He targets the elven figure with a Vortex Warp, but she shrugs it off and, now aware spells are being cast on her and having spotted the three of them, she casts Darkness on where they are. This is when Boromar as well as the people around start noticing something’s up. Bonzo and Petr attempt to move out of the darkness before Lux simply dispells it and though the assassin manages to get close to Boromar and attack him, she doesn’t manage to kill him before another Vortex Warp pulls Sumac away from her and towards where the group is. 

The  dinosaur construct then attacks the assassin, managing to pin her underneath, but before anyone can get too close she uses magic to get her way out, leaving an illusionary version of herself behind as she disappears.

With the commotion soon dying down somewhat, Sumac Boromar speaks to the Sharn Watch, seemingly commanding a lot of attention and respect from them. He describes what the assassin looks like, saying he wants this woman found. As he’s addressing the guard, Bonzo, Lux and Petr decide now is a good time to leave, sneaking away and leaving this situation behind. 

Meanwhile, Galen and Rydia have found their way to Galen’s parents’ house, where they’re welcome in by Helena calling them a ‘power couple’. When Galen questions this, she explains she’s just teasing and as they walk inside, they find that Daphne is already there. She tells Galen that Jonah couldn’t make it, which she’s actually quite relieved about, Galen assuring her that they can all meet him when she and he are ready for that. 

Beren walks in soon after, greeting the dog, Princess, first before walking in and greeting everyone else. Some small talk is had, before Rydia eventually takes of her cloak and mask, putting them aside. Beren, mid pour of some wine, spills some as his wife spits out some of her drink as well, though to their credit they soon at least try to act as if it’s mostly normal. 

Rydia is asked if she’s comfortable explaining what happened and after quickly checking in with Galen telepathically, she does explain, keeping things somewhat vague. Beren seems somewhat uncomfortable with things, but he does offer to help in his own way. Daphne and Helena soon excuse themselves to go set the table and after they leave, Beren brings up who Daphne’s dating.  

He seems pleased that she’s seeing someone from a dragonmarked house, sharing what Galen already knows; he always wanted one of his kids to marry someone from a dragonmarked house. Galen says he’s well aware of this, mentioning that Esme proposed, which leads Beren to say that he thinks Galen doesn’t like the dragonmarked house. Galen denies this and the conversation briefly turns to house politics before Beren calls for dinner to be served. 

Some small talk is had over dinner, until Daphne eventually brings up Jonah again. She tells her father that Jonah was looking forward to meeting him and that he had hoped to discuss some business as well. She adds that she doesn’t know the details, but he said he’s looking for some crystals. This prompts Galen to ask what Jonah does for a living, to which Daphne says that he tends to fix things for his house, solving problems and making sure clients are and remain satisfied. 

The dinner goes on and though things still seem somewhat awkward at times, everyone seems to roll with it for the most part. Rydia shows of her telekenises at some point, Daphne seemingly very impressed and asking about it. They talk about the differences between their magics, Rydia saying that hers comes with quite some downsides at times. Daphne offers to teach Rydia some illusion magic so she can disguise herself, to which Rydia says that she used to be able to do that, but not anymore. 

With dinner coming to an end, Galen asks to speak to his father, the two of them excusing themselves to talk in his office. He ask Beren if he actually intends on helping Jonah out, urging him to be careful when dealing with that man. Beren questions what Galen’s reason is for not trusting Jonah, Galen assuring him he has a good reason, but he will try to put that aside if it turns out he actually makes Daphne happy. 

Beren brings up Galen dislike for the dragonmarked houses again, mentioning Esme, to which Galen tells his father that he was never in love with Esme. He’s in love with Rydia. His father says he doesn’t believe the first part, but then drops the topic. They talk about Jonah again, Beren seeming to think that the chances of Jonah looking for the same crystals Galen is looking for are slim, but he does promise Galen that if it turns out they are the same crystals, he won’t help Jonah. 

Galen once again urges his father to be careful, asking him to keep an eye on Daphne as well and then Galen and Rydia take their leave, heading outside.

On the way back to the airship, Galen asks if they need to talk about what was said about Esme. Rydia admits that she was going to ask, so Galen explains that he and Esme were indeed engages at some point, but they were just good friends. Her parents really wanted her to get married, but none of the people they suggested were great, so one drunken night she jokingly said to Galen that maybe they should get married instead.

The joke then grew more serious, but it also made Galen realise that he didn’t want any of this, and he eventually decided to leave. 

Rydia then says that she thinks Galen’s dad is less disappointed in him than Galen seems to think he is, Galen pointing out he’s pretty sure his dad is convinced he’s been messing up ever since he left. He goes on to say that he doesn’t want that life. “All I want is you,” he says to Rydia, who is quiet for a moment, before saying she’s slowly starting to get used to hearing that again. She then says she feels the same way. 

They make their way back to the airship, finding Bonzo, Lux and Petr already there. The two groups talk about what happened and what they found out, discussing who all seems to be after the crystals now. It seems that outside of them, there’s Athelonia, now Jonah, and Galen shares that the second person who’s after this that he mentioned before is likely his former boss. 

With all these powerful or at least well connected people after the same thing, they agree that there’s more urgency to this than ever before. That being said, there’s not much they can do to speed things along that night, so they all eventually retreat for the night.   

Staying up for most of the night, Rydia eventually heads down to join Galen early in the morning. When she enters their room though, she finds the bed empty, bar for some traces of blood and a golden pocket watch, glowing in an eerie blue light.
