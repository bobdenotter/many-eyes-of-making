# Death on a Pale Wooden Horse

  



  

The day before, aboard the Heritage, Petr couldn’t get all the dream imagery out of his mind. He sat down in his quarters, mixed some dried mushrooms with some Dream Lily and poured some boiling water on it. As he waits for the substances to kick in, the incense smoke around him starts to change into a thick, yellow haze as a rough wind starts to blow around him.

  

He finds himself standing in a deserted city, several large rock formations towering around the city can be seen through the haze. It’s quiet except for the sound of Petr’s own cape flapping around in the wind. He recognises the city as Metrol, in the Mournland. He also notices that all the buildings are intact, although all windows have been destroyed and the walls are coated with a thick black grime.

  

In the distance, Petr spots a group of vultures; a couple of them floating above, three of them have already gathered below and are huddled around something. Approaching stealthily, Petr tries to get a better look at what they’re trying to eat.

  

Getting closer, he sees that some of these vultures all are nearly bald, and they start hopping aside. The vultures are clustered around a prone figure wearing this almost glowing blue cloak. Petr’s unsure if the glow is coming from the cloak or if it’s the haze around him.

  

He starts screaming and waving his arms, trying to scare off the vultures. The vultures do sidestep a little, and clear away from the prone figure. Petr can now see the figure is female, and has long brown hair. She’s facing away from him, so he can’t quite make out her face yet. “What are you doing here? Are you okay? You have to get up, we have to get out of here,” Petr says, but the female figure doesn’t really respond.

  

Moving in closer, Petr tries to get her attention; she still doesn’t really respond, but as he gets closer, he instantly recognises her face. It’s Mílika, Petr’s sister. “What’re you doing here? How did you get here?” Her eyes open, slowly, and as he brushes the hair away from her face Petr sees a massive cut-wound. Surrounding the wound, he notices a strange black-purple secretion with little bubbles in it. The same as he saw on the body of that Orc a couple of days ago.

  

Her eyes open slowly, and she recognises Petr, asking him where he’s been. He explains he’s been traveling, asking her why she’s here, as she’s supposed to be back at the farm with their parents. He tells her he thinks they’re in Metrol, but she seems completely out of it. He helps her stand and as they both get up, they realise a group of people have gathered around them. Halflings, mostly. They appear to all be naked, but Petr recognises some of their faces from the dreamlily den. Their skin looks diseased and blistered and all of their eye sockets are hollow as they stare at him and his sister.

  

Petr tells his sister this isnt’ good, they have to get out of here. “What do you want from us?” he shouts at one of the halflings, who all open their mouths at once and speak as one: "I am many, you are one." Petr asks them what that means, to which they say: "Are you the defector? I do not see any marks of making on your body!"

  

He denies that he’s the defector, saying he doesn’t know how they got here. “We were just leaving, and we will leave you to your business. If you just let us through, we’ll be on our way,” he says, as the vultures begin cawing loudly at the halflings, who are still staring at Petr. “You don’t know where it is then?” they ask him. “They keystone, that hides the key.”

  

Petr says he doesn’t know where any key is, turning to his sister to ask her if she knows anything about this, which she denies. The cawing becomes louder and then Petr is hit in the head with something sharp, and his vision begins to fade. He comes to back on the airship, in his room, and on his chest is a jet-black raven that is looking him straight in the eye.

  

Tied around the raven’s paw is a small envelope, which Petr reaches for. The raven is quite tame, letting him take the envelope, which Petr then opens to read.

  

Meanwhile, on the train, D4 comes chasing in after Rydia as she’s walking down the cart. “Oh no, I recognise that man back there,” he tells her, meaning the orc he saw just earlier. He says that he thinks it’s best to join with the rest. Rydia says she wanted to tell them what they found in the last cart as well and agrees they should find the others, so they start heading back that way.

  

They pass through the bar cart, which is a lot more crowded. Notably, Vornak the dwarf is no longer there, as he seems to have moved elsewhere. They reach Galen and Beck and the four of them share information, trying to deduce what their best plan of action is going forward. “The orc that screwed us out of the deal is back there,” D4 shares, with the others concluding that means the Daask is here. “It’s that or another interested party, which wouldn’t surprise me either at this point,” Beck points out.

  

Galen says that protection or not, they still need to get in there, which they all agree to. Discussing the plan, Beck says that he can pretend to be Errold who wants to inspect his goods. When Galen asks if he’s going in alone, Beck suggests that he’s pretty sure Galen is Errold’s type, so he could easily sell bringing Galen along.

  

“The warforged, they saw me,” Rydia points out, before saying she’ll be there regardless, promising she’ll keep an eye out. They saw D4 as well, so he offers to stay back and keep a watch on things from here. When asked what the plan is, Beck points out he has to change first. “Apparently I do as well,” Galen points out, pointedly unbuttoning a few more buttons of his shirt.

  

Beck then retreats to a bathroom with his Errold costume, changing in the bathroom as Rydia moves to another bathroom, using that to climb out through a window. Waiting outside, Galen notices something move by one of the windows outside. He sees the red-haired man the group noticed before, one of the Arcane Knights, flying by the window outside before moving out of view. He can then hear a loud ‘thunk’ from the roof of the cart.

  

Unaware of this, Rydia switches to Damned in the bathroom before climbing out the bathroom window, sticking to the side of the cart. On the other side of the cart, she can see the red-haired man as well, who seems to be battling two creatures. They look like humanoid jackals. Lying atop the cart is the dwarf that D4 was talking to before, Vornak, who seems to be unconscious.

  

They don’t seem to have noticed Rydia yet, who uses this to her advantage to climb along the edge of the cart to try and stay out of sight as she moves south. She looks in through the window, spotting Galen, telepathically telling him about what she just saw before saying she’s gonna keep on heading down to where they think they need to be.

  

Meanwhile, Beck has changed, making himself look like Errold before heading back out and meeting up with Galen again, who quickly informs him of what he and Rydia just saw. They don’t really know what to do about what’s going on outside, so decide to simply proceed with the plan, heading down towards the carts furthest down the train.

  

Atop the train, Vornak awakes confused, unsure how he got to the top of the train. The last thing he remembers was talking to some people at the bar. He soon realises the jackals near him aren’t friendly as he and Sarelo, the red-haired man, fight them, by casting thunderwave that gives off a loud thundering boom from the top of the train. They eventually manage to defeat the jackals between the two of them. The jackals seemed to be after the box that Vornak is carrying, containing the item Errold gave him the day before.

  

Meanwhile, down below, Beck and Galen have reached the fifth cart, where they run into Dugorim, as well as a few more jackals, some of the passengers seemingly dropping a polymorph effect as Beck and Galen move further in. Both of them get the sense that the remaining passengers are trying to figure out if more is about to come, but they’re not quite panicking yet, despite these odd circumstances and the loud back of the thunderwave they just heard.

  

Beck turns to Galen, asking if they should try and move past this, before Beck turns back towards Dugorim and the jackals. He pretends to panic, rushing forward, Dugorim bracing for an impact as he comes running, bodychecking him, which sends Beck falling to the ground. Galen, who ran after him, manages to catch him somewhat. “I think we’re going to have a little conversation, Your Highness,” Dugorim then says, addressing Beck / Errold.

  

Beck attempts to reason with Dugorim, speaking loudly as he does so. “You want to talk? I want to talk about the fact that I hired a bunch of people to protect me and they seem to be nowhere in sight,” he complains, before casting Suggestion: “Maybe you should help me with that.” Dugorim shakes of the spell, but agrees that Errold’s safety is paramount, perhaps somewhat sarcastically. “So if you just give me what you want, I’ll be out of your hair.”

  

The jackal-headed figure near Galen gazes in his eyes, but he shakes off the effect of its stare. Another jackal tries to same on Beck, who fails, feeling his knees buckle as he drops to the ground, unconscious. The magical slumber doesn’t last long though, as Galen shakes him awake again, making a show out of it.

  

From outside, Rydia is aware something is going on, quickly moving back to the cart that Galen and Beck are in. She stays outside, keeping an eye on things as inside the cart, people are panicking and beginning to run into the bar cart. This leaves Galen and Beck alone in the cart with Dugorim as well as the three jackal-headed creatures.

  

Beck, still on the floor, addresses Dugorim again. “If what you’re looking for is what I think it is, we have to move that way, don’t we?” he says, Dugorim yanking him back up to his feet so Beck can start leading the way into the back. Galen, as well as the jackals, follow.

  

At the front of the train, Varnok meets up with Errold as well as more Arcane Knights, where Errold tells the people working for him to please make sure the cargo is secure.

  

Beck / Errold leads Dugorim to the cart, explaining to the warforged they run into that he just wants to check on the goods, considering the ruckus they heard outside. The warforged steps aside, following the entire entourage as they keep moving in. The warforged outside the extra carts stop the jackals, who have since turned back into normal humans, from following, leaving Galen and Beck inside the added carts with Dugorim and the one warforged.

  

Looking around for something that reminds him of House ir’Lain, Beck hopes to spot something that’s somewhat familiar. He spots what looks like a small metal construct, sitting on one of the boxes, seemingly another form of protection. He nudges Galen before taking a look at it. “When you said you wanted to show me something special, I didn’t think we’d have company?” Galen says, with Beck pointing out that Dugorim kind of invited himself.

  

Dugorim moves right up to where Beck is as he looks at where the construct is, finding a box. “I’m very curious,” Dugorim says, with Beck muttering under his breath that he is as well. “What did you get out of that wench’s lair?” Dugorim then continues, as Beck tries to open the box. It reveals a beautifully crafted wooden horse.

  

The wood is a sort of warped, pale yellow, the wood looks like it’s been in the contanimated zone of the mournland for years, it’s old and weathered, but the craftsmanship still shines through. Dugorim looks over it, asking Beck what this is. “Is this some kind of joke? Where is the information? Where is the book?” Beck points out he didn’t say they were done yet, as Galen tells Dugorim to wait his turn, as he rudely interrupted them.

  

Seemingly not pleased with being spoken to like that, Dugorim spins around and slaps Galen with the back of his hand. He doesn’t even look at Galen outside of that, focused on Beck, telling him to give him what he wants, once again mentioning books and papers. Beck takes a closer look at the horse, not knowing what else to look for. He sees that in the neck of the horse, there’s a scratched symbol that he recognises as Yonhanna d’Cannith’s personal seal.

  

She made this thing herself. He also notices that there’s one strange thing about the horse, one strange imperfection, which is a tiny hole next to the saddle. Digging through his pockets for the thieves’ tools that were in the suitcase, Beck pulls out a tiny tool that he uses to try and insert something in the hole. Meanwhile, the warforged has taken a step forward, moving in a little closer now that Dugorim seems more aggressive.

  

As Beck drops a pin into the little hole, the saddle of the horse latches open and a compartment becomes visible underneath.

  

Meanwhile, back on the airship, Petr has opened the envelope that he got from the raven. In it, is a single piece of folded papyrus, and pinned to the back of this papyrus are two feathers held together by some string, and two red beads made of coral. As he opens up the note, Petr reads the following text in druidic:

  

“Don’t trust the pale woman you are traveling with.

  

Meet us during the new moon at the observatory in the towering wood.

  

Come alone.

  

Use the feather for your travels.

  

* The Gatekeepers”

  

Petr folds the note back up and puts it in his pocket, where he thinks it’ll be safe. He then takes a closer look at the feathers, realising that these are feather tokens. They are tied to house Vadalis, of the Mark of Handling. He knows you toss it in the air, and then a mount appears, in this case, a giant vulture. The creatures are trained by the house and then bound by magic so they can be summoned. He also realises that the new moon is about ten days away.

  

With the raven still there, Petr feeds it some of the scraps from his rations. “Thanks for delivering the message, little bird. You’re free to stay if you want, but if you want to leave, you’re free to go.” Before the raven leaves, it offers Petr a blank piece of paper, suggesting that he can use it to send a message back to the Gatekeepers.

  

He then heads above deck, checking in on the captain, who also catches him up on what the plan is and where they’re going. He doesn’t tell her anything about his dreams, instead telling her that he just slept for a long time.

  

The captain says that they’ll have to fly through the night, asking Petr to helm the ship for some of that; he’s been asleep for a while, so he offers to take care of the rest of the journey.

  

Back on the train, the compartment on the horse figurine pops open. The warforged steps closer, asking Beck / Errold if he’s sure about this, which Beck confirms. Dugorim sticks his hand into the figurine, grabbing a bundle of letters from it. The smell of perfume hits both Galen and Beck as he does so; the letters seem to be written on perfumed paper.

  

“So, what is this?” Dugorim asks, Beck trying to convince him to return the letters, so he can show Dugorim what this is. The orc hands the letters back to him, so Beck unfolds the letters, quickly trying to skim through them to make out what’s in the letter. Very aware of Dugorim’s presence, he panics a little as he scans the letters, which appear to be love letters of no significant value. All the letters are addressed to somebody named Aubrey.

  

Dugorim once again asks what it is, saying that this isn’t what he’s looking for. He’s looking for valuable documents on a certain location in the Mournland. He reaches out, grabbing for Beck’s throat, who manages to duck out of the way. “I’m really, really losing my patience,” Dugorim says, to which Beck simply replies with a “So am I,” turning towards the warforged and asking him to do something about this.

  

“Sire wishes for you to be dealt with, are we going to have a problem here?” the warforged asks as he walks in closer, stepping up next to Beck / Errold. Now surrounded, Dugorim looks straight at Beck and says “Do you know what’s so good about Siberys? There’s always a moon in it’s skies”. His jaw inches forward, his tusk growing larger as fur begins to sprout from his face and body; he turns into a werewolf.

  

Beck pulls out his rapier, trying to swipe at Dugorim, but his swing goes wide as Galen, from the other side of Dugorim, pulls out his pistol and puts it right to the orc’s back and pulls the trigger. He hits, but the bullet seems to almost bounce off, not doing any damage. Rydia, who just heard a gun go off, pulls the door to the cart open from the outside, everyone inside managing to hold on as a sudden wind blows through the cart.

  

She then moves inside, casting Ray of Enfeeblement on Dugorim, which hits, leaving him somewhat weakened. Dugorim lets out a cry as she hits him, which turns into a mind-shattering howl, leaving both Beck and Galen frightened. Dugorim continues to put up a fight, unleashing a number of attacks on Beck. The warforged misses both its attacks, but Beck manages to scare Dugorim off with Dissonant Whispers, leaving him to run away.

  

Galen uses this distraction to ask Beck for the wooden horse, tearing up some pieces from his journal and putting those in the horse to make it seem like everything’s normal, pocketing the actual letters, no one seeming to notice as Rydia moves further into the wagon, targeting Dugorim with a Mind Sliver, but he shakes it off.

  

Dugorim runs back, charging at Beck and knocking him prone right as another warforged as well as another member of the Knights Arcane join from the other cart, both of them moving in to attack, dealing a lot of damage to Dugorim.

  

Having noticed the back up arrive, Beck plays up the card of helpless little Errold, asking the new arrivals for help as Galen jumps onto Dugorim’s back, trying to help get him away from Beck. Dugorim then howls again, shaking Galen off before running away, the warforged attacking him on his way out.

  

The small construct that was guarding the small wooden horse did notice Galen switching out the papers and now considers him hostile, so it tries to attack him, zapping him with some electricity. Beck, now back on his feet, notices this and grabs for the construct, pulling it away from Galen and then simply throwing it at Dugorim, though sadly it goes flying wide.

  

As Dugorim continues trying to get away, Rydia reaches out to Galen telepathically, asking him if they need Dugorim dead. When Galen confirms this, Rydia goes after Dugorim and the two of them continue the fight atop the roof of the cart.

  

Down below, Kieris, the Knight Arcane, approached Beck / Errold, asking him if he’s okay, handing him a healing potion. Beck makes a show of being hurt as atop the roof, Rydia, with some difficulty, eventually gets the upper hand and manages to finish off Dugorim. With a final bite attack, she tears his head off.

  

Deciding to remain upon the roof, she notices that they’re approach what she knows to be Fort Zombie, indicating that they’re officially in Karrnath now. With Dugorim dealt with, Beck briefly speaks to Kieris, telling him to do a thorough inspection of all the goods, in a round-a-bout way confirming that the horse was the only special goods he / Errold had aboard this train.

  

With that confirmed, and with Galen in possession of the papers, Beck and Galen head back to meet up with the others, meeting up with Rydia outside of the cart. She looks hurt, so Beck heals her a little and they agree that Rydia will stay on the roof and out of sight as Galen and Beck head back to meet up with D4. Beck changes back into himself as they pass by one of the toilets on the train.

  

Back with D4, they discuss leaving the light atop the train, Galen in particular eager to leave the train, not quite trusting that they’re going to be getting away with this. When they realise that they’re only about thirty minutes away from where they had agreed to meet up with the airship, they decide to take their chances, staying aboard as opposed to jumping off the train right away. During that time, as they go through a tunnel, Rydia spots three platoons of bone knights inside of Fort Zombie, which the lightning rail passes through.

  

With the thirty minutes passed, D4, Beck and Galen head up onto the roof via one of the balconies, joining up with Rydia. D4 places the light on top of the roof, turning it green, before they jump off the train then, Beck using his Feather Fall to make sure that they land safely.

  

It’s another fifteen minutes or so before they can see the Heritage on the horizon. The captain and Petr lower the ship, throwing down the ladder so everyone can get back aboard the ship. As soon as they’re on board the ship, the captain congratulates them all on a job well done.

  

They move towards the captain’s quarters, spreading out the letters as Galen starts looking through them, in search of cyphers and code and anything worth noting. It doesn’t take him long to find one with a small drawing; a drawing of a faceted crystal. The letter speaks of being forcefully taken away, having to for now forsake their wonderful love story to work on a monstrosity in Clawrift. The letter also says: “If I do not manage to return, please find the stone we laid together. Behind it, you will find evidence of those who wish to draw out this horrible conflict.”

  

The letters are clearly written by Yonhanna d’Cannith. The recipient seems to be one Aubrey d’Orien, another dragonmarked woman. From his time with the Cannith family, Beck knows that love affairs between dragonmarked houses are severely punished; they are not legal, as they tend to lead to aberrant dragonmarks. The houses put a lot of effort and resources into keeping people apart. That also speaks from the letters; everything about them suggests secrecy.

  

Rydia instantly recognises the crystal depicted on one of the letters, instantly turning away and staring at a wall. Galen asks her if she’s okay, then asks her if this is the same crystal that Arag mentioned, which Rydia confirms. “Somehow, I don’t think it’s the illicit lovestory that the Sisters are interested in,” Galen points out. “Whatever this is, everyone wants it. I wouldn’t mind knowing why.”

  

Beck shares with the rest that he’s fairly certain that most of house Cannith that was working in Cyre is definitely gone, which likely includes Yonhanna. Aubrey d’Orien is likely also gone. He also realises that the stone they laid together is likely linked to the Metrol Railway Station, as Yonhanna architected this and house Orien is linked to the railways.

  

Listening to this, Galen faces the group and in a grim voice says “Are you suggesting we go to Metrol?”
