# Torn apart, Stitched together
With Galen coming to, Rydia checks in with him, telling him how she couldn’t reach him in his dream like she usually could. Galen describes his dream to her, wondering if his mother is actually in Sharn when they theorize about Galen’s dream having been influenced by the Dream spell. 

To check if that’s the case, Rydia sends a message to Beren d’Arcy, who takes a moment to respond. She asks him if he’s okay, to which he responds that he is not. “Someone came for me. Galen knows who.” 

Rydia is quick to follow that message up with another, reaching out to Zenobaal, alerting him to Karrnath interference in the city and asking him to check up on the D’Arcy residence. He responds instantly, agreeing to investigate.

Whilst they wait for a response from Zenobaal, Rydia asks Galen what he thinks is going on, to which Galen suggests that he can guess, fairly certain that his mother might be involved. Bonzo, having watched this conversation unfold, asks them if everything is okay, which Galen denies. They explain to him that it seems like Ophelia got hold of Galen’s father. 

Galen thinks back to the dream, and how it stood out to him that Beren seemed to be asking simple, almost stupid questions when he first spoke to him. He thinks Beren might’ve been tasked by Ophelia to try and get information out of Galen, but he instead tried to warn his son. 

Sharing this with the others, Galen tells them he’s getting really tired of Ophelia coming after all of his loved ones and for some reason leaving him alone. 

With all this going on, Bonzo asks if they still intend on going back to Making the following morning, which Galen is quick to say that they should still do. Bonzo rightfully points out that, if they succeed the following day in retrieving the crystal, they will be bringing it right to where Ophelia might be, but none of them really know where else they’re supposed to bring the crystals. 

Galen turns to Rydia then, asking if she can arrange for him to speak to Ophelia in a dream. Rydia thinks for a moment on whether or not she’s met Ophelia, or knows what she looks like, and having seen her in one of Galen’s dreams once, she thinks she can at least try. Before casting Dream, she casts Intellect Fortress on Galen (and on herself and Bonzo), and she and Bonzo watch as Galen falls back onto the bed in a trance of sorts.

Galen, in said trance, is soon to realise that this doesn’t seem to be working, deducing that Ophelia likely isn’t asleep. He decides to wait and see if she will fall asleep later, not wanting to waste Rydia’s spell.

Meanwhile, Zenobaal has reached the D’Arcy residence, reporting to Rydia that the lights in the residence are out and there’s no signs of a break in or anything like that. He does spot a pocketwatch on the door, which seems very similar to the one Galen had. 

He goes on to say that he then swung by Altenar Artefacts, where he saw a body in the office on the top floor. Rydia asks him to describe the body and is quick to recognise Beren D’Arcy, who Zenobaal describes as being slouched on his chair with a golden dagger in his heart. 

Rydia wakes Galen, pulling him out of the Dream spell, before carefully telling him that Zenobaal found his father. Galen is quiet for a moment, before thanking Rydia for trying. Rydia asks Zenobaal to get rest of Galen’s family to safety as Galen wakes Beck and Petr, who have been asleep throughout all this.

Galen catches Beck up, saying that he doesn’t know what to do. In the background, Lina stirs as well, awoken by all the commotion. Beck is quick to suggest that Galen, Rydia and Lina should go to Sharn to see what they can do, telling Galen that he’s needed elsewhere right now. Lina, now caught up as well, says they can easily get back here within a couple of hours.

It takes some convincing, but they all eventually agree and Lina starts setting up a teleportation circle for herself, Galen and Rydia. A few seconds later, the three of them find themselves back in Sharn. 

Though somewhat shaken by this all, Bonzo and Beck manage to get some rest that night as Petr offers to be on watch, keeping an eye out at the camp. 

As Rydia, Galen and Lina arrive, Rydia receives another message from Zenobaal, who informs her that he’s found Galen’s mother and he’s now on his way to pick up Galen’s sister. Rydia suggests that she and Galen can go check out Altenar Artefacts, though Galen asks her to check in on Daphne before they do. She does, and Daphne seems to be okay, Rydia’s message having woken her from her sleep. 

Rydia tells her that someone’s coming over to get her to safety and Daphne agrees to start packing some things. 

Considering Lina, who wants to check up on Esme, has to go to Upper Central and that’s also where the office is, all three of them hop into a skycoach and head towards that part of the city. There, Lina gets out and heads to her home to go find her wife, as Galen and Rydia find their way to Altenar Artefacts. 

Though he doesn’t have a key, Galen makes such quick work of picking the lock that the nearby Sharn guards don’t blink an eye, and he and Rydia head inside. Galen takes a moment to ponder on his father’s security, but when realising that doesn’t activate til after the last person leaves, he starts running up the stairs. 

Rydia follows and upstairs, in his office, they find Beren D’Arcy. He’s seated behind his desk, slouched forward, with a golden dagger sticking out of his chest. Galen suggests they should search the place, Rydia pointing out the guards they saw outside, who she goes to get after Galen says that’s a good idea.

With Rydia outside, Galen takes a moment to try and get his emotions under control before he looks around his dad’s office. There’s a few things that stand out to him. The dagger seems to be a ceremonial dagger, one he recognises from some of his dreams. There’s some fine grey dust around the chair his father is sitting in and to the side, he notices that two of the balcony doors aren’t locked, and may well have been the way in.

There’s blood spatter on the desk and, as he looks a little closer, he notices that something is lodged in his father’s throat. 

A moment later, Rydia returns, with some of the Sharn guard in her wake. One of them introduces themselves as undercaptain DeVos, speaking to Galen, asking him if he’s related to this man. Galen confirms this, before pointing the captain’s attention to what he saw, with the captain putting on a glove and carefully removing whatever it is that’s lodged in Beren D’Arcy’s throat. 

It’s a piece of cloth, wrapped around a ring. In Elvish, there’s some text on the cloth, that Rydia translates for Galen: “This was for Rosalyn Karlagh”. The name rings a bell for Galen, who knows Misstress Karlagh to be part of the Sanguine Council. It seems like she needed to be avenged for some reason.

The ring itself is a signet ring, with a symbol of a skull and two roses. Galen knows those two crossed roses are the sigil of the noble house of Karlagh in Karrnath, recalling that they are a minor noble house and they own some baronies around the Mror Holds.

As Galen talks the guards through some of the other things he noted, Rydia receives another message from Zenobaal, who tells her he’s secured both Helena and Daphne and brought them to his home. Both had a pocket watch on their doors. 

Galen and Rydia then realise that the halfling woman from the Sharn Watch who spoke to them before, Undercaptain Reveria, is also amongst the people now at Altenar Artefacts. She recognises them too, offering her condolences before asking if Petr is with them. She asks if they can send him her way if he does return to Sharn, which they agree to do, though Rydia points out it’s perhaps somewhat appropriate to be asking them of favors in these particular circumstances. 

She apologises, before Galen asks to be excused, with Rydia following him back outside. There, Galen mentions the pocket watches, thinking it means that Ophelia and her people are watching. Rydia asks Galen if he wants to go see his family, but though Galen seems to want to do that, he doesn’t really know what else he’s supposed to do.

He tells Rydia he wants to send his family somewhere safe, somewhere even he doesn’t know about, with Rydia agreeing that seems like a good idea. She says they should keep doing what they do, make sure Galen’s family is safe. She then brings up his mother, asking if she should tear Ophelia apart. 

Galen says that he doesn’t think that will fix the pain, Rydia then clarifying that all she wants to know is whether she and the others should hesitate when they find her. Galen says no. “She won’t, so neither should we”.

Thinking back to when he left and sought out his mother, Galen expresses regret, saying all he ever got after that was death and Xoriat. Rydia tells him the latter part of that was also partly her fault, mostly wanting to point out that none of this is Galen’s fault, or at least not just his fault. 

She uses this opportunity to tell him that she’s fine now, and Galen isn’t. “Whatever you think you did to me, I forgive you,” she says, before adding that he took care of her for six months and now it’s her turn to take care of him. 

Galen points out they don’t have time for grief, Rydia assuring him that when they do, she will be there for him. She also reminds Galen that she and all the others have his back and that he’s not doing this on his own.

They then head up to Zenobaal’s, with Lina messaging Rydia when they’re on the way. She tells her that Esme is fine and Rydia suggests they all meet up at Zenobaals, before correcting herself and calling it the Sensos residence. She then also messages Jonah, just to check in on him. She scares him awake, but he seems to be fine and, when asked, he reports that there’s no pocket watch on his door. 

At Zenobaal’s, Galen finds his mother and sister, who know something is wrong, but haven’t been told about Beren yet. He tells them about the message he got in his dream, how Beren was in it, going on to say that they were too far away to do anything. “Dad’s gone,” he concludes, with Helena bursting out in tears and Daphne asking if he’s sure. 

Galen tells both of them what they found, saying Beren was murdered. “Something to do with my birth mother,” he elaborates when asked if he knows who did it, which further upsets Helena. Daphne seems to be holding it together, though is clearly upset as well.

Through her tears, Helena talks about how she always knew Ophelia was trouble, how she warned Beren to deal with her a long time ago, but he didn’t. Galen assures her that none of this is her fault, with Helena and Daphne both instantly telling him it’s not his either.

Galen goes on to say that Ophelia is making threats against them, which prompts Daphne to pull out the pocket watch that was on her door. Galen confirms that is part of what he means, with Zenobaal quickly swooping in and taking the pocket watch, promising to put it away behind lead. 

Galen then goes on to say that he wants his family to get somewhere safe, which is right when Lina and Esme walk into the room. Esme says she knows a place that’s safe, assuring Galen it really is quite well protected when he asks. Galen then apologises to them all for putting them all through this, though they all point out that none of this is his fault. “I know, but she won’t apologise for this, so I will”. 

As the sun can be seen rising through the windows, Daphne, Helena, Esme, Lina and Zenobaal move to the side to discuss where they can go, purposely away from Galen and Rydia. Helena and Daphne express regret at not getting to say goodbye to Beren, to which Zenobaal says he’ll take care of Beren’s body, offering to gently repose him so, when the time is right and things have settled down, they can say goodbye and have a proper burial. 

This prompts Helena to ask when it’ll all be over. “When I fucking end it,” Galen responds, Rydia quickly correcting his ‘I’ to ‘we’. He promises his mother that he’ll take care of it. 

Meanwhile, back at the warforged camp, Beck and Bonzo awake to a loud bell ringing. Petr very helpfully informs them a bell is ringing, and that it’s time for them to get up, which they do. They head to the commander tent, where they find some of the camp already gathered. The Lord of Blades is on his throne, flanked on each side by Hilt and Scimitar.

The Lord says that the briefing by Hilt and Scimitar will determine whether and how they will plan the assault on Making. With that lead up, Hilt starts talking about what they’ve found in their time in Making. 

He talks about an entrance that is indeed hidden in the park, noting that the park as a whole is illusionary. As such, he suggests that they should bring the crystal, which would dispel the illusion and potentially other protective magic as well. 

Outside of the illusionary magic of the forest, the secret entrance is also protected by a pass phrase. Once you get through the entrance, you’ll find yourself in a hallway, that branches off to an entrance to the palace. If you follow the hallway, it will eventually lead to Clawrift, up and around which a base was built by House Cannith. Through the secret entrance, you’ll arrive on the eastern end of things, which Hilt says is where the barracks and other such things are.

The western entrance, which the crew has already used, is dedicated to propaganda and is located within the tower.

He goes on to speak of a large open gorge, a phenomenon that clefts the place in twain, which they know to be the manifest zone. There’s a set of stairs that leads down towards the original control room of the experiment, which is also where the dream cradles are. This place is protected by a door that he and Scimitar know requires three keys. 

They recall that Yonhanna was usually the only one down there and when she went down, she would say that she’d ‘take her unicorn for a walk’. 

The Lord of Blades then asks about how many people are in this place, to which Scimitar tells him that there’s roughly ten inspired, plus Yonhanna. He also mentions there’s a mob of what he calls commoners. They are armed, but not well trained. 

Bonzo asks if these commoners are under some sort of control as well, which Hilt and Scimitar confirm, though, after sharing a look, they correct him on the term ‘control’. They explain that it never felt like they were being controlled, more like they were being manipulated. It felt like an alternate reality to them. 

They go on to say that these commoners have been told that the camp is there to stop Yonhanna’s plan from bringing things back to the way they were, so they have a to them reasonable reason to fight. Logically, they will try and stop them if they come in. 

This prompts Hilt to speak up about how though his mind fog has lifted, he’s now somewhat more inclined to see the side of the ‘enemy’. The Lord of Blades reinstates his intentions; he just wants this piece of land for himself and his people. He doesn’t necessarily wish harm on anyone outside of that. 

Bonzo suggests that a course of action could be that they break the control that these people all seem to be under, the Lord saying that he thinks that means they have to get to Kalaraq. Strangely, when he mentions that name, it doesn’t seem to ring a bell at all for Hilt and Scimitar. 

There’s a brief discussion on a plan, Beck and Bonzo sharing that they know of a pass phrase that might work on the secret entrance, and also mentioning that they might have an idea of where they can find the three keys, or at least the ‘unicorn’ that was mentioned. 

They eventually agree that the Lord of Blades and his people will attack using the secret entrance, and Beck, Bonzo, Petr and Novac will teleport to the tower, where they will meet up with the rest and then head inside to find this ‘unicorn’ key. 

With a plan somewhat agreed upon, Novac uses Sending to inform Lina. 

The crew as well as the warforged then gather their things and start making their way back towards Making. It’s a large convoy, of roughly twenty five well-armed warforged and as such, they are left alone when crossing the strange glass plane. Four warforged carry the large crystal with them and they soon find their way to the park.

From around the crystal, a bubble can be seen, dispelling the magic inside it, showing just how much of this forest is made up out of an illusion. Strangely, when one touches the foliage of the forest just outside the bubble, it does feel real, suggesting it is a very high level illusion being kept up. 

Through the forest, they reach a large door with a ramp leading down to it. The Lord of the Blades turns to the crew, reminding them they said they might know the pass phrase, so Beck walks up to the door and speaks the phrase Jonah gave them for the tower: Flicker flame and furnace blast, The children of making I let past.

It works, and the door opens, revealing a heavy fog inside. As the warforged and the crystal move in closer though, the fog disappears, seemingly magical. 

Bonzo peers inside, trying to discern more details, but he can’t see too much outside of strange stones that seem to hanging from the ceiling. He warns the warforged of these, who march inside whilst he, Beck, Petr and Novac hang back. 

Novac messages Lina to tell her they’re teleporting in now, before pulling out the scroll of teleportation circle and casting that spell. Within seconds, the group teleports into the tower. 

Back in Sharn, Lina has been relaying the messages she got from Novac and when the second message comes in, she tells Galen and Rydia it’s time to go. She says goodbye to her wife as Galen takes the time to say goodbye to his family as well. Before they teleport out, he makes sure to thank Zenobaal as well, who points out that they’re not even remotely square, considering what the crew did for him. 

They step through Lina’s teleportation circle then and soon the crew are reunited, back in the tower of Making.

There’s a brief moment where they try to catch up, Bonzo asking them how it went and Galen quickly catching everyone up. He says he thinks Erandis Vol has been busy and that his father’s murder was in revenge of the murder of this Rosalyn Karlagh person, but he doesn’t get to elaborate much on this before an alarm rings.

The crew rushes down the stairs and towards the vault door, momentarily stumped on how to open it as there doesn’t seem to be a handle. Beck and Galen think back on how the door was opened by the Inspired before, realising it was psionics, so they both turn to Rydia, who pushes the door open with her mind. 

Having been aware of what route they took last time, Rydia then leads the way until the group eventually comes to a split in the road. Rydia tells them one way leads through to the room with the clones and the other through to the museum, but both ways end up in the large room with the rift. 

Beck suggests they go through the clone room, as taking out Yonhanna’s clones ahead of time seems like a strategic move. Once inside, they see six vats in the room. Four of them are full of clones that look like Yonhanna and one contains an unfamiliar human male. He has a dragonmark, a Mark of Making, yet none of the group knows who he is. 

Rydia asks if they really intend on taking out these clones, Beck showing some hesitation before saying that yes, they should do this. Rydia urges everyone to move through to the other end of the room, then casts Sickening Radiance on all the vats with clones, who slowly start withering away. 

At the door through to the next area, Beck, Petr and Galen all smell the scent of burnt hair and as Galen checks the door, he can feel the handle is hot. He can’t hear much though, the roaring of the rift too loud for him to be able to discern anything else. 

He wraps his hand up in the end of his coat before touching the handle and pushing the door open and they’re all instantly met with an intense noise.

As everyone else steps through into the next room, Beck is frozen to the spot as he can feel the dragonmark on his back growing and moving once again.
