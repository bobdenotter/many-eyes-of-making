# Apex Predator





Faced with the large dragon now hovering over them, they can all see that it’s clearly ancient, weathered with age, but it’s massive black and green eyes are moving around swiftly as it still seems acutely aware of its surroundings.



The enormous scaled face of the ancient black dragon has completely taken over Beck and Petr’s vision, casting a shadow over all three the guardians as well as Rydia and Galen too. It’s peering over all of them and as everyone reacts to this sudden presence, Rydia realises that she’s not the only one seeing it. “Oh, you see it too...”



Beck turns to the dragonborn guardians, asking them if the dragon’s with them. He can clearly see that they’re frightened; Nerima gulps before she starts to speak, seeming somewhat dumbfounded. Once she finds her voice though, she does confirm that she thinks the dragon is with them. Knowing that the dragon might not be a threat, Beck waves at him.



The stone cracks under the dragon’s weight as he snakes his head closer towards all of them, nostrils flaring as he sniffs the air. He soon focuses on Rydia: “I smell a betrayer. And its book,” the dragon says. “Where is it?” he then demands, his close presence unsettling all three of the guardians as well as both Rydia and Galen.



Petr, having always wanted to see an actual dragon, is finding himself somewhat intimidated by this one’s presence. He wildshapes into a velocirapter, attempting to blend in with the other reptiles in the area.



From a distance, Bonzo saw the dragon emerge from the large tarpit and started moving in closer with the airship. [[Azaka]], completely dumbfounded by the sight of this dragon, yells out at Bonzo, confused about him moving closer to the dragon. He tries to fight Bonzo for control of the helm, but Bonzo threatens him. telling him to step away from the wheel. Azaka is for a moment more frightened of Bonzo than he is of the dragon and steps away, allowing Bonzo to keep the ship on course, heading towards his friends and the dragon.



Seeing the dragon focus in on Rydia, Galen leans towards her, telling her “I liked it better when it was mauve[\[a\]](#cmnt1)”. He then makes sure to position himself in front of Rydia to try and protect her.



Still frightened, the three guardians move backwards as [[Nerima]] speaks. “Oh great [[Rashaak]], we are your humble servants still, what can we do for you?” [[Rashaak]] calls them fools, pointing out they’re standing right next to the traitor. Rydia, also frightened, backs away as her shadow moves towards the dragon. She holds up her hands. “I never betrayed anyone. I mean, my parents were … but that was different. What’re you talking about?” she stammers as she keeps moving away.



Beck continues trying to talk to the dragon, also addressing him as ‘oh great Rashaak’. “They found the book on accident, they didn’t mean to touch it,” he says. “This clearly affected her which is what you’re seeing. We’re here to ask for your help, your advice.”



The dragon’s eyes fix on Beck for a moment. “I’m not here to debate with an aberrant, your little friend over there is carrying the book, I can smell it. She may have touched it by accident, but she’s carrying it still and I want it.” He goes on to say that when the book is his, they can talk about advice. “If she has the book she doesn’t know it,” Beck continues, telling Rashaak they’re more than willing to help him get to the book.



Rashaak drops himself down from the building then, reaching out to grab for Rydia. Seeing this happen, Galen reacts by moving in closer, getting swiped up along with Rydia as [[Rashaak]] grabs both of them in one large claw. He then raises himself up, showing just how tall the dragon really is as Rydia and Galen are provided with an almost aerial view of the ancient city.



Seeing the dragon grab his friends, Petr, still as a velociraptor, moves to jump onto one of the dragon’s hind legs, hoping to latch on in case the dragon takes off with his friends. Rashaak definitely notices Petr jump on, but doesn’t instantly react.



Galen, in Rashaak’s clutches alongside Rydia, turns to her. “Do you really have it?” he asks her quietly, hoping the dragon won’t hear. “I don’t know. I touched it, I saw things, lots of things, many things, so long, so … so many things, I was so hungry, so hungry…” Rydia responds, trailing off.



Back aboard the ship, Azaka starts climbing down the ship’s ladder, not wanting to move closer to the ship, as Bonzo continues navigating it towards the dragon, hoping to help his friends. The guardians, still frightened, move away and once again address Rashaak, asking him how they should proceed. “How can we help you get this book?”



He responds, saying he’s still thinking about how to do that himself. The velociraptor on his leg annoys him somewhat and distracts him from his thinking, so he swipes at Petr with his tail, successfully knocking him off and back to the ground.



Still on the ground as well, Beck moves along with the dragon, attempting to continue their conversation. “You don’t need to hold them up there, we can help you from down here,” he says, attempting to convince the dragon to let his friends down. “Quiet, I’m trying to think,” the dragon says, “this one’s in the way.” He does start lowering his body, seemingly moving as if to set Rydia and Galen down.



As he lowers his claw, Rashaak’s gaze intensifies and he’s looking at Galen and Rydia, yet seemingly looking straight through them. “I’ve got it,” he then says, before looking straight at Rydia. “Read,” he says, as Rydia tries to determine what he’s trying to do. It almost feels like Rashaak isn’t talking to her anymore; he’s noticing something in or on her that doesn’t seem to be her own conscious being.



Realising this, she gives in to [[Rashaak]]’s command. Galen sees her take a deep breath, the slight fear in her eyes turning into mania as her skull splits in two, the maw on her shoulder growing larger and larger, drooping over Rashaak’s claw. Whispers are starting to come from the void, which seems to please Rashaak.



Petr, lying in one of the pools on the ground, scrambles back to his feet and hides behind one of the nearby bridges, staying close but wanting to stay safe as well. Bonzo, having moved the ship close enough, lowers both himself and Betsy down to the ground so he can join his friends, trying to take in the situation.



Galen, who is now stuck between a dragon and a maw, can understand some of the whispers, recognising the languages of Daelkyr and Draconic. He hears parts of the poem about the eyes and their locations, and there’s one word in Daelkyr that stands out due to it being repeated over and over again. Galen doesn’t recognise it at first, but then realises it sounds like “Golden Grin”. That single term is surrounded by insane laughter.



Suddenly, from the other side of the dragon, an arrow shoots out and hits Rashaak. The dragon turns around to some bushes behind him, and the others also notice a feral looking tabaxi, giving out a hunting call. Beck moves closer towards the tabaxi, calling out to him: “What’re you doing? We’re in the middle of something!”



The tabaxi responds with a simple “Death in honor!” as he keeps running towards the dragon, shortswords drawn. Seeing the tabaxi doesn’t seem to want to stop, Beck calls out to Petr to alert him about this new development as well. “There’s trouble, and it isn’t the dragon!”



Rashaak takes off into the sky, flapping his wings and hitting both Beck and the tabaxi with the force of it. He hovers about 20ft off the ground, with both Rydia and Galen still in his claw. Frustrated, Rashaak grumbles about ‘ants’ before a jet of black acid shoots out of his mouth, straight at [[Bag of Nails]], the tabaxi.



Meanwhile, Petr drops his wildshape, trying to get closer to Beck and get a better view at what all is going on. Bonzo, now having joined the others, is somewhat confused about what’s going on, so he calls out to his friends: “Who needs my help and why?”



The space around the group fills up with abyssal whispers, which seem to affect both Galen and Bonzo. (Both gain a point of corruption: Galen - trusting, Bonzo - reckless). The tabaxi continues trying to attack the dragon, leaping off a tree and trying to get on the dragon, but sliding back off one of his wings as he can’t hold on to anything. Beck attempts to cast Suggestion on Bag of Nails, but the spell doesn’t take, so he fails in convincing the tabaxi to move away.



“All these ants, I can’t concentrate,” Rashaak grumbles, frantically looking around and hoping to get away. He beats his wings again, knocking Beck, who only just got back up, back down onto the ground. He moves away, still holding on to Rydia and Galen as he does so. Afraid the dragon might fly off completely, Petr, Beck and eventually Bonzo head towards the airship in an attempt to be able to follow. On his way to the ship, Bonzo watches the dragon fly by, shouting at it: “C’mon, I just got here, you coward!” He takes a shot at the dragon, which hits.



Meanwhile, Galen, still in the dragon’s grasp right next to Rydia, is somewhat frozen and unsure of what to do. Looking at Rydia, he sees crumpled pieces of paper swirling around in the maw, half digested. He tries to see what’s on it, but won’t risk touching it, so he can’t really make out any details.



Nerima and the two other guardians meanwhile manage to shake themselves out of their fright of the dragon. The three of them fly off after Rashaak as Bag of Nails continues pursuing the dragon from behind, still taking shots with his longbow.



Rashaak dives down onto an old building a little more to the south, which crumbles under his massive weight. As they land, Galen spots [[Azaka]], who’s still trying to get away from this situation as Rashaak, now away from all distractions, focuses intently on the whispers coming from the void. He puts both Rydia and Galen onto the ground, resting his massive head next to Rydia to listen. “Yes, sing, tell me everything,” the dragon says. Galen, now on the ground, sits down on the ground next to Rydia in a daze.



The dragon whispers to Galen, attempting to convince him to keep the rest away, but the Dominate spell doesn’t take and instead shakes Galen out of his fear.



Meanwhile Petr, realising that the dragon seems to mostly want to be left alone so he can listen to the whispers, gets aboard the airship, unsure of what else he can do. Bonzo takes a different approach, attempting to chase after the dragon atop Betsy, charging in the direction of Rashaak. He reaches out towards the dragon, attempting to cast Reduce, but it doesn’t take.



This immediately gets Rashaak’s attention, so Bonzo calls out to him: “Leave my friends alone!” The dragon retaliates by swiping at Bonzo with his tail, knocking the wind out of him and telling Bonzo to leave him alone.



The dragon’s violence seems to cause another wave of abyssal whispers and Galen and Bonzo are once again affected (Another point of corruption: Bonzo and Galen - compulsive). Now thoroughly having snapped out of it, Galen picks himself up from the floor. He looks up at Rashaak. “Give her back”.



Rashaak turns back to look at Galen, staring at him. “She’s possessed, she’s not who she used to be,” the dragon says, to which Galen simply repeats his request. “You and what army, ant?” Galen draws his gun, but instead of aiming at Rashaak, he aims at Rydia.



Both the guardians and Bag of Nails keep moving closer, the guardians seeming to want to calm everyone down as the tabaxi has a single mission: fight the dragon. Rashaak flexes his wings as he’s hit with another arrow, roaring in pain. He is quick to focus back on Galen though, telling him to let Rydia finish before he uses his dragon’s breathe, a jet of acid spewing out and washing over Galen.



It knocks him unconscious, but then his pocket watch comes to live, whirling as a cold energy comes from it and it pulls him back up. Petr sees this happen from aboard the ship and starts turning the ship, calling out to Beck and Bonzo to get aboard so they can hopefully get to Rydia and Galen, and then get out of there.



Bonzo starts backing away towards the airship, somewhat distracted as he’s counting all the bullets inside a box. As he’s walking back, he hears the abyssal whispers again (another point of corruption: Bonzo - moderate fear of aberrants). He gets a good glimpse of what Rydia has become, and a shiver runs down his spine.



Still facing off with the dragon, Galen asks Rashaak what will happen to Rydia if she finishes. “Then I will know what the traitor wrote, and I can start doing something about it.” When asked what will happen to her, [[Rashaak]] says he’s never encountered a creature like her before. “She might be able to turn back.”



“And if you stop now?” Rashaak says he then won’t know what the traitor has written down. “Clearly she’s carrying the tome, can’t you see?” His eyes turn to the maw, and Galen notices multiple pieces of paper swirling around, as well as the stained golden cover, which he recognises. “I don’t know how she’s carrying it, but she is. Let me finish this.” He goes on to say that he believes Galen’s friend, that he believes his guardians, suggesting he at least acknowledges they’re not necessarily enemies(?).



“If I don’t get her back, there’ll be hell to pay,” Galen says, before putting his gun away and raising his hands. The guardians stop a little away from Galen and the dragon, one of them noticing Bag of Nails. They point this out so all three of the guardians move towards the tabaxi, taking shots at him with their shortbows. Bag of Nails continues targeting the dragon, hitting him once more with a longbow shot.



Both Beck and Bonzo manage to climb aboard the airship as the dragon turns its head towards the approaching tabaxi and attacks with another jet of acid, which hits. Galen, noticing this now too, takes out his gun and aims at the approaching Bag of Nails, hitting. Two of the guardians take a shot at the tabaxi too, the combined hits enough to send the tabaxi stumbling to the ground, muttering “glorious” before falling completely down.



Having left the other two guardians to deal with the tabaxi, Nerima has made her way over towards Galen, Rydia and the dragon, attempting to calm the situation by casting Calm Emotions on all three of them.



The dragon is intently listening to the whispers coming out of Rydia’s maw, at peace now that things are more under control. Pieces of the terrain are completely gone because of the acid, which is biting its way through rocks as well as plant life. Beck, Petr and Bonzo move the ship in closer, lowering it down so they can join Rydia and Galen. Petr even suggests they pick up Azaka, but they agree they can try and find him later.



As they join the others, Beck picks up some of the whispers as well, recognising some parts of it as draconic. Those parts seem to mainly concern druidic magic; various places and spots. He hears descriptions like ‘the vaste monolith that is sinking’ ‘the observatory that watches all’; vague phrases of what are likely locations. There’s a nature theme to them and they’re surrounded by mentions of nature, power that nature can grant, adaptability and survivability of creatures in the wild. Every so often, these locations are in between as well.



Beck makes sure to translate what he hears, realising it might mean more to Petr than to him. He’s somewhat distracted by the translating, but Galen, who also speaks draconic, recognises a name. Daryll Alistair. It goes on to say that Daryll was a pupil, who ventured down into the maw with her, her presumably being Vvaraak. Ever since, it seems to have cursed his entire family.



Being from Sharn, Galen recognises the name Alistair, but he doesn’t know of any Daryll. He thinks he’s probably long dead. The tome that spills out mentions him as the starting point.



The whispers go on in Daelkyr, sounding much more maniacal and nonsensical. Surrounded by bursts of laughter. Things like “Tik tok, tik tok” “Rats in a maze” “I hunger” and more repeats of “Golden Grin”.



Meanwhile, Rydia finds herself in complete darkness. As soon as Rashaak cast the spell on her, she lost consciousness. She can’t see much as first, but when her vision clears a little, she realises she’s in a cavern. She can hear the sound of dripping water and there’s a musky smell in the air that stings her nostrils.



She reaches up, feeling her neck, somewhat surprised to not find a maw there. She runs a hand through her hair, pulling it into view, realising it’s brown, and no longer white. In a nearby puddle, she can see her reflection: she looks like her old self. “Oh no,” she mutters.



She calls out a “Hello” then, her voice echoing through the space. Looking around, she realises the cavern continues on into a massive tunnel; there’s a way to the east, and a way to the north west. The way to the east seems to have a flickering light at the end of it, and the other way shows a low, greenish color fog.



“I don’t think I’m ready for you yet,” Rydia says in the direction of the light, before turning down the tunnel into the fog. Her skin starts to itch as she enters the fog, and as she scratches at it, flakes of skin start peeling off, like she’s shedding. She keeps going, her footsteps becoming less and less loud as a dusting of skin flakes covers the floor, dampening the sound of her steps.



As she scratches at her arm again, she realising it doesn’t hurt as more and more skin peels off, eventually revealing sinew as well as muscle. It still itches, but there’s no pain. “This is safe”.



She heads further down the tunnel, which opens up into a larger space. There’s a bit of an air current in this area, some of the mist gets blown past her. To her right, she sees what she thinks might be a ghosts, before realising it’s chunks of shedded skin on stalagmites, whistling in the breeze. The skin seems to belong to a single, larger creature.



Low to the ground, she hears a whooshing sound, billowing green mist curling up before her. Taking a closer look at the sheets of skin around her, she realises they have scales.



“Excuse me,” Rydia calls out, “can you hear me?” A low, rumbling voice responds as there’s movement, and a large green snout appears from the darkness. “Yeah, that tracks,” Rydia says, before Vvaraak tells her she’s not done yet. “What’re you doing here?”



“I’m not sure… one of your friends wanted to know things,” Rydia explains, describing the black dragon to Vvaraak. “He’s no friend of mine,” the green dragon says, “nor should he be of yours.” His words are followed with laughter, which he tries to shake off. Rydia changes the subject, asking what they’re trying to do, why she’s not done yet.



“Those eyes. You need to get them before they trigger the Coming,” Vvaraak says, trailing off, his words followed by mad laughter which soon fades as Rydia regains consciousness.



As she’s coming to, she can overhear Rashaak talking to Galen. “She’s dangerous. You should end it now, make it quick, painless,” Rashaak says, which Galen is quick to shut down. “Don’t you dare.” Rashaak simply repeats that Rydia is still a danger. “You do not know what you’re talking about. She’s corrupted. This isn’t the same woman that you’ve known. She’s dangerous. Who’s going to keep her in check, are you?” Galen is quick to confirm this.



“And what if she turns into something even bigger and scarier than this? Are you saying you’re not distracted by this form?” He pauses, commenting on how most of Galen’s kind seems to shy away from things like this. “I got her into this. I’ll deal with the consequences,” Galen responds.



At that point, Rashaak perks up, commenting on how they’ve started again. He starts flapping his wings, yelling at his guardians to do their jobs as he starts moving away, towards the massive crater and tar pit. From atop the ship, Bonzo can see ten individuals gathered around an obelisk, seemingly performing some sort of ritual.



They all see the dragon move away from the palace, only Bonzo seeing him attack this group, using his breath weapon again, but seemingly to no avail. The creatures do scatter, searching for hiding places as another area on the map shimmers for a moment, revealing more of the tar pit. Rashaak dives at it, straight into the tar pit.



Meanwhile, Rydia slowly starts to grow together again. Everything hurts and she has a splitting headache, but otherwise is back to the way she was before. Beck wonders if they’re supposed to follow the dragon, but Galen is focused solely on Rydia, moving over towards her.



“How long was I … minutes, years?” Galen tells Rydia she was only gone for an hour or so, after which Rydia asks about the black one.. “I think I just had a conversation with the green one..” she then says, going on to say that he said the black one is not her friend. “That might be true, but I don’t think we can do much about it,” Galen comments.



“I thought Rashaak was trying to help, was I wrong? How wrong was I?” Rydia asks, to which Galen admits that he doesn’t know. Rydia then asks what happened, noting that Galen looks rather terrible. “You look like a housefire was in a different housefire.”



Galen explains what happened, saying she got worse and there was a fight and he got doused with acid. “Rashaak wanted to listen to what you were saying. And then it stopped, and he left.” Rydia says she thinks she needs to talk to Petr about the green one, as Galen changes the subject.



“Rydia. What happened to them?” She breaks eye contact with Galen. Three new eyes form on her left side, all Rydia’s eyes and they all start crying. Galen spots a single golden tusk in the corner of her maw. “Why am I alive?” Galen then asks. Rydia says she doesn’t know, stumbling over her words.



“I woke up without a scratch on me. Why?” Rydia repeats that she doesn’t know. “I didn’t want to remember any of that.” She really doesn’t know. Galen then asks her if she’s okay, and Rydia laughs. “I haven’t been okay for months.”



She then changes the subject back to what happened, saying she now wants to know more about Vvaraak. “I didn’t leave, did I?” she then asks, Galen asking her to clarify. “I was in a cave, there was skin. It was hers. And mine,” she says, explaining what she saw, after which Galen confirms that she was here the whole time. “What was left of you anyway.”



“We have to find the eyes to stop the Coming,” Rydia then says, relaying Vvaraak’s message. “That’s what she told me.” Galen looks around for the others, spotting Beck and Petr who have been hovering somewhere nearby, keeping quiet. Galen asks if either of them know what the Coming is, which neither of them do. Beck does comment it doesn’t exactly sound like a good thing.



“One of the eyes is here,” Beck points out, with Galen adding that maybe they should get to it then. Beck’s unsure if the eye itself will help them with what they’re trying to do, pointing out they’re here for a reason and that was to try and figure out what happened to Rydia. Galen wonders if it matters, but seeing as they’re not going anywhere in a hurry.



Rydia then tells the group that Vvaraak told her she wasn’t done yet, Beck asking her what that means. “It means I have a purpose?” Rydia suggests, though Vvaraak didn’t tell her what the purpose was - she thinks it might have something to do with the eyes. She was never told about the eyes before though. “How are you supposed to not be done with something you never knew you were supposed to do?”



She points out she has a tendency to forget things, so it’s not unlikely she was told before, but she could’ve just forgotten. Beck says that she’s told them this time, so that at the very least means there’s now five people who can forget.



He then says he would like to talk to the black dragon some more, though considering Rashaak left, that’s not as easy. Galen points out he needs a minute anyway, looking rather rough so Beck reaches out to heal Galen and heals him with a Healing Word.



“That’s not what I …” Galen says. He sighs, leaning down to kiss Rydia on the forehead before he walks away, heading towards the ship, leaving a dumbfounded Rydia behind. She then follows him towards the ship.



The guardians, who left with the dragon and stayed there, combatting some of the lizardfolk, eventually fly back over towards the group. Some of them look rather hurt. [[Nerima]] lands near the group, saying she’s afraid they can’t keep doing this. “It is too much for us three. Our lord is back down; he felt the demonic overlord loosen his chains, so to speak.”



Beck offers help in dealing with these people; Nerima says that the crystal / eye is theirs if they help them deal with the lizardfolk. “Can we speak to Rashaak as well?” Beck asks, which Nerima says can be arranged once he’s done subdueing the overlord. She also points out that, as the group saw, not even Rashaak is immune to the Cold Sun’s corruption, and it’s made him more paranoid.



“He will not share information with just anybody, especially not an aberrant like yourself,” Nerima continues, and though Rydia thinks Nerima’s talking about her, Nerima explains that she’s talking about Beck. “You have the wild mark, correct?” she says, which Beck confirms, and Nerima says that Rashaak could sense that from a mile away.



Beck points out he thinks the conversation earlier went well enough, saying he’s hopeful it will go well a second time. “What can I say, you were very persuasive. You managed to calm him down,” Nerima says. Beck then suggests that maybe they rest up before dealing with anything else and Nerima agrees, offering to guide them all to a safe place.



“There’s an altar in the northern cliff; underneath it is a large arena. The arena is mostly abandoned. The altar is.. bad news, but nobody’s been there in years. Inside there you’ll be mostly safe.” She starts guiding them there and they follow with the airship.



They take [[The Heritage]] down to the former arena of [[Haka’thorvak]]. They can see a ruined amphitheatre that looms over the surrounding buildings. Vines cling to its steps and animal statues line its stands. The ground is partially underwater and muddy and there’s an eerie silence that hangs over the area. Nothing seems to stir.

![[amphitheatre.jpeg]]

Nerima leads Beck, Petr and Rydia to chambers underneath the amphitheatre that are cloaked in thick fog, which obscures vision but doesn’t seem to obstruct breathing. There’s various old dilapidated rooms, some of them crumbling. Both Galen and Bonzo remain aboard the ship.



“You can rest here. In the meantime, me and my colleagues need to be vigilant in case they attack another dawn shard,” Nerima says, drawing out a little map in the sand. “The dawn shards are what keep the Cold Sun at bay. They are located in a grid,” she explains. She goes on to say that the barracks is where the lizardfolk are keeping the two other keys, and it’s also where the majority of their forces are.



She suggests coordinating an attack and drawing the lizardfolk away from the barracks. When Beck asks how many there are, she says she estimates there’s about thirty to forty of them. “We’ll think on it, you think on it,” Beck suggests, wishing her good luck as she and the other two guardians then take off into the sky again.
