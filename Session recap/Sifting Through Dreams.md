# Sifting Through Dreams
As tensions are rising, [[Athelonia]] takes a moment to look around, taking in her surroundings. Then, through gritted teeth, she addresses the orc [[Uldun]] who still has his bow drawn, telling him to come to where she is. He hesitates, mentioning [[Kryx]], the gnoll, who isn't with them. She says she knows, but urges him to come over anyway, which he does, lowering his weapon.

[[Athelonia]] turns to Beck then. "We weren't going to do bad things with it, you know. If you're ever interested, you can find me in Metrol" she says, before waving her hand around her blade and casting Wind Walk, allowing her and her compatriots to escape. 

Galen asks if everyone's alright, Petr saying he's far from alright, but this ended far better than he thought it would ten minutes ago. As they're talking, one of the poison dusk lizardfolk approaches Galen, holding out a bundle of dragonshards to him. "Nerima told us what happened. I'm sorry I didn't believe you before" he offers, Galen instantly assuring him it's not his fault. The lizardfolk thanks him and the others for their service to their city, Galen in turn thanking him for the shards. 

The lizardfolk excuses himself then, though he says he'll keep some of his men posted near the ship in case Athelonia and the others come back. Galen asks him if he has everything he needs to deal with the city's corruption, the lizardfolk assuring him repairs have been going smoothly. "This happens every once in a while" he says, indicating they're used to this and know how to handle it. The only thing they have left to do is deal with the lizard that turns people into stone, which he says they will. 

Nerima moves back up to the group then, shaking each of their hands, thanking them. "You've done the Order of the Corroded Shields a great service." Beck thanks her for her help in turn. Like the lizardfolk, Nerima promises she'll keep an eye on the crew whilst they're still here, before she and her people will return to the mesa upon which they all saw her when they first flew into Haka'torvak. 

Bonzo suggests they get to work on fixing the ship and they run through all the things they need. They have the copper as well as the dragon shards now, Beck pointing out there's a large wooden club somewhere in the city that they can use for the wood. Galen suggests they stay together for now, so they all head out to retrieve the club, Beck telling the story of how he and Nerima ran into a two headed troll that threw it at him and it landed somewhere in the city. 

They soon find the club, somewhere atop a building and after briefly trying to figure out how to bring it with them, Beck turns to the group, asking if any of them would be okay with being turned into something else. Petr agrees, so Beck uses his new sword to cast Polymorph, turning Petr into Banana Candy, the t-rex that they came across back in Gatherhold. 

Petr, as a t-rex, manages to grab hold of the club and moves it back towards the ship, where they set to work turning the club into actual wooden planks they can use to fix up the ship. Working together, they manage to mostly get that done that night, Beck then suggesting that Rydia cooks up a nice meal for them all, as they've clearly earned that. 

She does so, with Petr's help, incorporating the axes that Bonzo started working on in her kitchen into the risotto that she makes, sending a clear message that she didn't appreciate him working on his things in her kitchen. Bonzo promises it won't happen again and as they sit down to enjoy their dinner, they discuss everything that happened in the past few days. 

Galen asks Bonzo what he did to piss of Irae so much, to which Bonzo explains what happened back in Gatherhold. He shares that he was approached by the Daask, specifically someone named [[Harash]], who asked him to build a boat. He agreed to this, got to work, and shortly before he finished they mentioned they were going to use it to sail to the [[Mournland]]. 

Beck recognises this name, as Harash was the name of his initial contact that he and the captain spoke to who recruited them to steal the warforged way back when. They met back in a small podunk town in Aundair. 

"It wasn't up to those specifics, so I tried to make some last minute adjustments to make it able to do that, but it was too little time, too little materials ..." He tried to warn them, but they still went to the Mournland. When they got back, something happened to the ship and it caused an explosion. "Which I think was what caused the fire in the Glowing Kipper." 

"A couple of people are mad at me, blaming me that it happened" he goes on, explaining that it probably wouldn't have happened if he'd known what they wanted to use it for and provided him with the right materials. "That's what caused me to want to get out of Gatherhold." Galen asks if the Daask are mad at him because of that, which Bonzo thinks they are. He explains he initially tried to get out of Gatherhold via the train, but there were Daask agents on there, so he got off the train again. Looking for another way out, he eventually found their airship. 

"I suppose I am partially to blame, but I mean .. it isn't totally my fault" Bonzo continues, Galen agreeing as Beck adds that he thinks those halflings didn't stand a chance anyway. He explains that he and the others saw those halflings right before the explosion; they were high on drugs and would've had no chance to get away. "There might be a couple of people in Gatherhold that think we are responsible for that fire" Galen says, adding that his former employer assumed they were the ones who caused the fire and they didn't deny this assumption. 

Bonzo admits that he still feels a little bad about what happened, because he's the one who made the boat, the others trying to convince him that he's not responsible for something he made being used in the wrong way. This leads to Bonzo mentioning he was an engineer back in the war, where he made a lot of tools, war machines, weapons. Though he didn't design the boat to hurt people, those things he built back then were build to hurt people, and people died because of things he made. He feels bad about this. 

"The person who made my gun isn't responsible for what I do with it" Galen points out, though Bonzo isn't so sure. "Where would you draw this line, Bonzo?" Rydia asks, pointing at her butter knife, suggesting that if she tried really hard, she could probably hurt someone with it. "Does that mean the person who made a butter knife is responsible?"

"Did the person who made the butter knife think it would be used that way?" Bonzo asks, going on to repeat that he made things that were intended to hurt and kill people. "Thats a bit different than a butter knife, isn't it? I was an engineer for the army ..." Beck points out he isn't anymore, before suggesting that maybe he should invent things that bring joy from now on out. 

Bonzo says he did try doing that, as a merchant; he made trinkets, toys, tools, but he ended up in Gatherhold and they weren't in much demand. Then the Daask approached him, and he admits he was quite excited to build something as mechanical and technical as a boat. Then it exploded, and caused a lot of deaths. 

There's a moment of silence, before Galen says that explains why Irae was after Bonzo, noting that the lady who was with the group seemed to know Beck. Beck explains that he saw her before, in Metrol. "Remember we found the dream lily?" He adds that he, as well as Petr, used the dream lily and both of them saw Metrol when they did. When he went to Metrol, she was there as well.

"I also saw her in whatever dream Masvirik caused" he adds, before saying he didn't expect to see her in person here. Galen asks who she is, so Beck explains - she's Queen Athelonia. The mother of the people who wound up running the different parts of this world.

Rydia suggests maybe they grab some drinks, as this is all a lot to take in. "Didn't they say we could find them in Metrol? That's in the Mournland.." Bonzo points out, Beck saying he doesn't know how it works, but he was transported to Metrol when he used those drugs. He asks Petr if he knows how it works, but Petr honestly isn't sure how exactly it does either. He does confirm he indeed saw Metrol as well when he used the drugs. 

Thinking back to when they ran into Athelonia earlier that day, Rydia recalls that Athelonia did seem to recognise Beck. She points this out to Beck, who agrees that confirms that it's weird. "Clearly I was there and she was there, somehow."

Galen muses on how they keep picking up more problems instead of less, the group collectively taking another sip of alcohol. Beck admits he didn't quite expect Athelonia to be real, but clearly she was. Galen then asks her what he thought she wanted to use the crystal for, Beck sharing what he saw in his dream. "She wanted to use it to cause another Mourning."

This turns the discussion to their dreams, Petr theorizing that if some parts of the dream were true, then maybe the nightmares were more real than they thought. They go around the table, each of them sharing what they saw in their dreams. 

"Our ship crashed and you all died" Galen shares, Beck pointing out that hasn't happened yet. "What do you mean yet?" Bonzo asks, so Beck says he's just assuming the worst now. Galen explains some more, saying he got the impression it was something to do with him, as Petr in the dream said something that made it sound like it was his fault. Considering almost everyone died, he adds that he would like to avoid that dream coming true. 

Bonzo then shares what he saw in his dream as well. He explains he was in the back of a cart, hands and feet tied and he was being taken to some kind of tribunal. "To be set to trial for my war crimes." They said they lit his mother's bakery on fire and hurt his family. "I'm not even sure if it's true or if it was just a dream, but I think I need to check on my family..." Beck suggests maybe they can use the eye, before Rydia realises she can reach out to Bonzo's mom. One of her many eyes turns into the right direction. 

She reaches out to Mrs. Boltsnapper, getting a response from Bonzo's very confused mother, which does confirm she's still alive. She asks how Bonzo's doing in turn, to which Rydia says Bonzo is doing fine, now speaking out loud as she replies to the message. 

Beck leans over to Galen, asking if Rydia was always able to do that, to which Galen says this whole thing is still kinda new. Beck then asks Rydia and Petr about their dreams.

"In my dream, Rydia was there ... which was weird," Petr says, before explaining some more. He was at his ancestral home and both his sister and his father were there, his father not doing so well. Rydia was also there, in the cellar, opening a portal. "We got into a bit of a fight and she tried to steal my staff" Petr goes on, saying it was weird. He apologises to Rydia then, thinking he might've been acting weird around her as he tried to make sense of this. 

"As I said to Bonzo, weird is kind of normal, I know I'm a little out of the ordinary" Rydia points out, before musing on how she's pretty sure she can't open portals, trying to do so. Petr then suggests that he might know of a way to check if the dream was real or not. Rydia met his sister in his dream; if she can reach out to her via her magic like she just did to Bonzo's mom, then that means she met her. 

Rydia tries this, but can't seem to reach Petr's sister, thus seemingly confirming that the dream wasn't real. She then says that for her dream, she ignored what she was seeing. "I knew there was trouble and I knew it wasn't real, so I just tried to get out of it." She does add that she saw Galen, as well as the other two who were formerly part of their adventuring party, as well as her old self. They seemed to be happy about something, but she didn't stop to ask what it was. "The real us were in trouble."

Galen summarizes that most of their dreams seem to have been nonsense or at least things that haven't happened yet. "Maybe it is just a nightmare, something to turn us against each other, play on our fears or ... " Rydia jokes she could try asking Masvirik, Galen and Beck saying it might not be smart to do so. 

"So what now?" Galen then asks, Beck saying that Sharn seems to be their obvious new destination. They were told someone was there who could tell them about the Eyes and the Coming and Galen says there's someone else in Sharn they should try and track down. The Alistair person who was mentioned, who seemed to have been with Vvaraak and who's bloodline was somehow cursed. Someone that looked like Rydia was involved. 

Galen says he has plenty connections in Sharn, Petr adding that he lived in Sharn for a while as well. Both Bonzo and Beck visited at some point in time as well, meaning Rydia is the only one who's never been there before. As they're talking about Sharn, Orvex knocks on the door post, asking if they can drop him back off in Newthrone on their way back. They assure him they will, inviting him to grab some of the food as well. They also decide to pick up Azaka's body and bring him to Newthrone and ask Orvex to update Lumiz somewhat on what happened here in Haka'torvak.

Musing on how he's going to have to go see his parents if they go to Sharn, Galen shares that his father is part of the Aurum, so is one of the guys they're looking for. "Seems like a good place to start." Petr says that he knows just the place for Galen to go in Sharn, where they can get him something to calm his nerves, though Galen seems less than enthused about this idea. 

"Any other deep dark secrets anyone needs to get of their chest before someone else tries to kill us?" Galen then asks, and thankfully no one responds. Beck brings up the Eye then, asking if anyone else wants to use it, pointing out they wanted to use it to talk to Vvaraak. Galen says he has so many questions he wants to ask, but he doesn't know if using the Eye a lot is smart. On the topic of Vvaraak, Rydia says she already got to speak to him, and she's felt slightly better since. 

Galen then asks if they're actually going to do this. "You're the one that said we were destined to do this" Beck points out, Galen saying everything just seems to line up. They agree that this all sounds important, but at the end of the day the only one who told them to go find the Eyes was Vvaraak, the 'rogue' one. Beck points out it kinda works; they have an airship and they've been called pirates before, so rogue fits. 

Beck suggests they do their research, look into things as much as possible, though Galen says he doesn't think there's books in the world that can answer these questions. Beck also realises that if it comes to the Mourning and how it went wrong, he could try and reach out to House Cannith, who were the ones who presumably caused the Mourning. They might have documentation on what happened, and there's also plenty of people who dislike House Cannith who might be interesting allies. The Aurum might actually be one of said potential alies.  

"I'm just saying that something this powerful could lead to all sorts of things" Galen says, adding that if people are going to come after them for this, they're going to at least need to realise what they're signing up for. Petr points out that at least they have good intentions, which is better than anyone else getting their hands on these things. 

Beck points out they don't really know anyone they can go to with any of this, so for now it seems like they're the only ones who can do anything with this. "I think Sharn is a good place to start" he adds, Galen saying he has a friend who might be able to help with this. Sharn is where people might have information, so it just seems like the logical next step. 

Beck then suggests that maybe they should sleep first, before making any other decisions, so they all retreat for the night, taking turns in keeping an eye out during the night. Petr and Rydia take the first watch, during which Petr gets assaulted by a tiny corrupted lizard. He offers it some mushrooms, then tosses it overboard. 

Orvex joins Rydia for the second watch, during which not much happens, other than Rydia catching Orvex staring at her for a moment and telling him she thinks that's a completely normal way for him to respond to her. Orvex admits he'll never get used to this, to which Rydia says she used to think she wouldn't either, but she's had moments lately that suggest otherwise.

For the third watch, Rydia wakes Beck, before she herself retreats to join Galen in their quarters. She sneaks into the room without him noticing. During his watch, Beck doesn't see much happening around the ship, except for Nerima and some other dragonborn flying off into the sunset, probably heading towards the mesa. He spends his time on watch fiddling with the tarot deck that used to belong to his wife, attempting to pray to Olladra.

The following morning, Galen wakes up with Rydia beside him, which is a pleasant surprise. He thanks her for doing this and the two of them talk. Petr has meanwhile gotten up early, heading out to collect some bugs which he then returns to the ship. They have breakfast, make some final repairs to the ship and after a test run around the city, they pick up Azaka's body. 

After they do so, Petr suggests that he could make Azaka walk into the bar, order a drink, as if nothing happened. He can cast Animate Dead on him. They sort of discuss this, but no one really tells Petr that he shouldn't do this. Rydia points out it's a bit morbid, but also very funny. 

They head to Newthrone then, and the journey is largely uneventful. During the trip they encounter three birds, who appear aboard the ship and ask for 'shinies'. The crew initially offers them some shiny objects, which seems to displease the birds, but Petr manages to trick them by offering a dagger upon which he casts Green Flame Blade, which is enough to convince the birds to leave.

Both Bonzo and Petr also take the time to use lesser restoration spells on everyone so they no longer suffer from Masvirik's corruption. With the corruption gone, Bonzo notes he feels much better, after which Galen holds up his pocket watch, asking if he's been playing with that the whole time.

Beck confirms this, asking what the pocket watch does, so Galen explains it brings him back up after he's been knocked out. Beck asks him where he got it. "Remember back in Gatherhold, there was someone waiting for me at the Golden Dragon Inn? That's where I got it." He adds that someone wants to keep him alive, though when Beck says that's a good thing, Galen admits that if killing himself despite who gave this to him was an option, he would. 

"So you don't know why she wants to keep you alive?" Beck asks, Galen saying that he doesn't really know. "It's not out of the goodness of her heart, I'm pretty sure." He's not sure what it is, what's going on, or how to stop it. Rydia points out that not everyone they meet can be evil, after which Bonzo points out that they were told Galen was the heir of something. 

"Could that be the reason they want to keep you alive?" Galen isn't sure, mostly because he doesn't know what it means to be an heir of Aerenol, and the part of him having elven blood makes no sense to him. "This is to do with the dreams I told y'all about" he adds, before repeating that whatever she wants him alive for, probably isn't good.

Bonzo asks who this 'she' is, so Galen explains he used to work for some Karrnath people, and this 'she' is who he used to work for. "Karrnath and not dying and undead..." Beck muses, to which Galen says he knows. Bonzo asks what Galen did, who explains he was somewhat of a research assistant. The people he worked for were looking for magic items, trinkets, etcetera. He wasn't working for her when he found the book though. 

Beck asks if this person knows about him finding the book, Galen saying that Mortem Pent, the guy who came to the inn, did ask about the book. "He asked, and I lied. And I'm gonna ask you three to promise me the same thing I made Rydia promise, which is if you ever see anyone with a golden skull, you don't tell them." He doesn't want them to know they found it.

"What does the golden skull mean?" Beck asks, Galen explaining it stands for the organisation she belongs to. He's heard his former employer call it the [[Sanguine Council]]. It doesn't ring a bell for anyone else. "They're just wrapped up in bad shit, that's all I know" Galen adds. He also mentions the dreams he had before.

"They were talking about Aerenol and now I'm apparently the heir of Aerenol, I don't know ..." Bonzo asks him what exactly they did to him in the dreams, to which Galen says there was a needle and they injected him with something. Something to do with his blood. 

He also says he thinks the only people who might have answers to any of these questions are them, and he doesn't want to go looking for them. "You wanna know what I'm really worried about?" Galen then says, before saying that when they found the book, everyone else died except him. Beck points out Rydia also didn't die. 

Galen says he doesn't know why he didn't die and he's hoping 'why' isn't because of what they did to him. He wasn't awake, so he can't recall, and Rydia doesn't remember either. Galen theorizes maybe he died, though Beck says he doesn't seem very undead to him, Bonzo pointing out that it's strange they would send him the watch if he's not even alive anymore.

Rydia, thinking she has a way to prove that Galen isn't undead, cuts her own hand before biting Galen. If he's undead, his blood wouldn't heal her. She does heal, though the taste of Galen's blood apparently affects her to the extent that her eyes roll back and the maw bursts open, emitting a loud roar, after which Rydia seems completely out of it. For a moment, she feels helpless, her powers leaking away as she feels like plain old Rydia, but with a massive wound on her neck. 

The roar scares Bonzo, who runs below deck as Galen does the opposite, running towards Rydia and attempting to snap her out of it, which does eventually work, but takes some time. Rydia's senses return to her and she asks what happened. 

"The maw did the thing again and you passed out" Galen summarizes, asking her what happened in turn, but she doesn't know. She says she was just trying to test whether or not he was dead, she didn't expect anything else to happen. "Is this why I'm alive?" Galen wonders, Beck asking if he means to say that he's alive because he somehow doesn't taste good. 

Beck then also points out that Galen wasn't quite left unscathed after what happened with the book; the blue things that keep shooting out of his stomach seem to have been caused by whatever it was. "I don't really know where one goes with questions like these" Beck then says, to which Galen says he just wants to know why he's still standing and the two people who can answer that for him, he's not ready to talk to. 

He explains that the people he would have to talk to are dead, and whilst Beck might have been ready to speak to those he lost, Galen say he isn't ready to have that conversation yet. "Not sure I'll ever be ready to have that conversation honestly."

Rydia apologises, saying she simply wanted to help answer one of Galen's other questions, and she didn't expect anything like that to happen. Galen wonders what's wrong with him, which amuses Rydia, as clearly she hasn't quite been left unaffected either. 

"If this is because of the book, Vvaraak might know" Beck suggests, though they can't speak to him until they figure out what plane he resides on. Galen sighs about more questions, Beck pointing out they at least seem to have a starting point. He then suggests maybe they should grab some more drinks when they drop Azaka off at the bar, which the others think isn't a terrible idea.

Galen seems somewhat lost and upset about what all is happening and what is going on, so Beck attempts to reassure him, tell him he's not alone, which doesn't really seem to convince him. They decide to just go for the drinks, parking the ship above the harbour where they left it before. 

Before they head down, Rydia pulls Galen aside for a moment. She comments on how he's shown her that he doesn't really care about everything that's going on with her. "In several ways, that I found really ... reassuring." She kisses him. "Do you understand what I'm ..." she then says, and when Galen says he doesn't, she explains that the same goes for him. She doesn't care if something happened to him. "Also, you taste fine to me" she comments, before walking away.

In the meantime, Beck checks in on Bonzo, who hid away in his workshop and is working on some things to try and distract himself. Beck tells him it's over and that they're going for drinks. "Is Rydia okay?" Bonzo asks, which Beck considers a loaded questions, before he hesitantly says that she seems to be back to 'normal'. 

Beck then asks Bonzo if he's okay, which he confirms. "Just okay" he adds, which they agree is better than expected, but also worse than it can be. He then reassures Beck he'll be okay, and they join the others. 

Petr has meanwhile written some notes, folding them up and putting them in some of the pockets of Azaka's jacket and then he reanimates the body. He, as well as the undead animated body of Azaka join the others. Orvex excuses himself, thanking the group for the flight back and heading in the direction of the House Tharashk people, seemingly glad to be getting away from the animated corpse.

Bonzo casts Alarm on the ship before they all head down, Galen asking Petr if he's sure he's not from Karrnath as they make their way through the somewhat crowded streets of Newthrone. Galen and Petr spot some enforcers walking the streets of Karrnath; an older man wielding a rifle, as well as a larger, four armed warforged that's carrying two guns as well. The enforcers look over the crew, but don't notice the zombie, and simply greet the group before moving along.

They make their way towards the [[Gold Dragon Inn]], where they initially found Azaka as well. It's very crowded inside, as the sandpits on the lower floor are being used for a boxing match. They manage to find a seat in the back of the bar, where it's a little less crowded. 

Petr has Azaka follow behind the group a little distance, so it's not immediately apparent he's part of the group. As he walks in though, the barman instantly recognises Azaka, who Petr has move towards the bar. He has him pull out a note, with a gold coin in it. The note reads 'please keep the liquor flowing'. The barman is asking Azaka some questions, but simply starts pouring him drinks when he doesn't responds.

After they're seated, Galen asks everyone what they want to drink before he heads to the bar to order said drinks for everyone. He's given some ale as well as a bottle of Firewhiskey. Whilst the barman works on his order, Galen notes the single gold coin that he also spotted before when they were at this same bar. 

After the barman returns, Galen pays him and then asks him about the coin. The barman mentions a woman who he just can't get out of his mind. "Gorgeous, absolutely cracking" he goes on, before the fight in the sandpit distracts him for a moment. He turns back to Galen then, continuing about how fantastic this woman is, though when Galen asks, he admits he's never asked for her name. 

"What does she look like?" Galen then asks and the bartender starts describing her. "She wears a black dress", and as he continues describing her, the door to the bar opens up and the woman herself walks in, dressed in black, with a familiar golden mask and scythe.
