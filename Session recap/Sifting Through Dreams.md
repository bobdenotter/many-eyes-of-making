# Sifting Through Dreams
As tensions are rising, [[Athelonia]] takes a moment to look around, taking in her surroundings. Then, through gritted teeth, she addresses the orc who still has his bow drawn, telling him to come to where she is. He hesitates, mentioning [[Grix]], the gnoll, who isn't with them. She says she knows, but urges him to come over anyway, which he does, lowering his weapon.

Athelonia turns to Beck then. "We weren't going to do bad things with it, you know. If you're ever interested, you can find me in Metrol" she says, before waving her hand around her blade and casting Wind Walk, allowing her and her compatriots to escape. 

Galen asks if everyone's alright, Petr saying he's far from alright, but this ended far better than he thought it would ten minutes ago. As they're talking, one of the poison dusk lizardfolk approaches Galen, holding out a bundle of dragonshards to him. "Nerima told us what happened. I'm sorry I didn't believe you before" he offers, Galen instantly assuring him it's not his fault. The lizardfolk thanks him and the others for their service to their city, Galen in turn thanking him for the shards. 

The lizardfolk excuses himself then, though he says he'll keep some of his men posted near the ship in case Athelonia and the others come back. Galen asks him if he has everything he needs to deal with the city's corruption, the lizardfolk assuring him repairs have been going smoothly. "This happens every once in a while" he says, indicating they're used to this and know how to handle it. The only thing they have left to do is deal with the lizard that turns people into stone, which he says they will. 

Nerima moves back up to the group then, shaking each of their hands, thanking them. "You've done the Order of the Corroded Shields a great service." Beck thanks her for her help in turn. Like the lizardfolk, Nerima promises she'll keep an eye on the crew whilst they're still here, before she and her people will return to the mesa upon which they all saw her when they first flew into Haka'torvak. 

Bonzo suggests they get to work on fixing the ship and they run through all the things they need. They have the copper as well as the dragon shards now, Beck pointing out there's a large wooden club somewhere in the city that they can use for the wood. Galen suggests they stay together for now, so they all head out to retrieve the club, Beck telling the story of how he and Nerima ran into a two headed troll that threw it at him and it landed somewhere in the city. 

They soon find the club, somewhere atop a building and after briefly trying to figure out how to bring it with them, Beck turns to the group, asking if any of them would be okay with being turned into something else. Petr agrees, so Beck uses his new sword to cast Polymorph, turning Petr into Banana Candy, the t-rex that they came across back in Gatherhold. 

Petr, as a t-rex, manages to grab hold of the club and moves it back towards the ship, where they set to work turning the club into actual wooden planks they can use to fix up the ship. They manage to mostly get that done that night, Beck then suggesting that Rydia cooks up a nice meal for them, as they've clearly earned that.
