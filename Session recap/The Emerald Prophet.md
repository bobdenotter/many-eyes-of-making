# The Emerald Prophet

  



  

As Petr is packing up to prepare for his journey, Rydia hands him a wrapped box, explaining she made a cake for his mom. Petr asks if there are drugs in the cake, but Rydia says that’s more his thing, and the cake just has cream in it. Petr thanks her for the gift, assuring her his mom will love it. Rydia tells him to have fun before leaving him to finish packing. Completing preparations, Petr and the Captain head out into Korranberg and towards the Lightning Rail, crossing the river via cable car. The Captain is quiet on the journey, Petr making idle conversation as they reach the grand station in Korranberg, before boarding the train to head north. The journey is about fourteen hours to Passage, leaving them arriving fairly late at night. Fianin suggests she knows a good place to stay if Petr wants to spend the night in the city, which Petr agrees would be a good idea.

  

It’s late at night when they finally arrive in the city of Passage, and as Petr heads through the streets he sees a number of posters. As he stops to inspect them, he finds they describe a human man, a pale companion with a maw and a possible changeling who are wanted for questioning, with the Knights Arcane offering a reward for their apprehension. Sneaking one of the posters into his bag, Petr follows after the Captain towards the Khoravar district of the city. Approaching one of the homes, Fianin knocks on the door, which is opened by a white haired half elf with two different coloured eyes. He immediately embraces her, greeting her with a kiss as Fianin wipes away tears, introducing Petr and the half elf, Shivaro, to each other.

  

He invites them in for supper and offers beds for them to stay the night, Petr explaining he’ll only be here for the night. The half elves are extremely hospitable, and the next morning Petr departs the house after breakfast, using the feather to summon a black feathered eagle. Mounting the bird, they take off in the direction of Greenheart, good weather allowing Petr to make good time across the shores of Lake Gallifar. He arrives there in a couple of days, finding a tree in the village which is singing a lament in Druidic for the war with Aundair and the loss of their brothers in Redleaf. After resting up, the locals point him towards the Observatory, a mesa with a number of large stone monoliths standing on top, seemingly tracking the moons. Arriving in the middle of the afternoon, Petr settles himself in for a wait.

  

As he waits, a traveller emerges from the woods, wielding a quarterstaff in a cloak and basic gear. Looking over to him, Petr recognises an old friend of his, Thom. Petr asks if he’s a Gatekeeper, Thom explaining he used to be, but has been recently been roped back in. It’s been five or six years since the two have seen each other, and Petr is glad to see him, asking if he sent the letter. Thom says he did, with the agreement of some of the other Gatekeepers. Petr admonishes him for not putting his name on the note as he almost didn’t come. They agree they have a lot of catch up on, Petr asking if Thom is going to explain what’s going on. Thom agrees, the two finding a spot to talk in the Observatory.

  

Thom begins with a grand story, explaining how a green dragon named Vvaraak taught the druids of the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches druidic magic. The dragon also warned them of the coming of something called the Daelkyr, a group of alien beings hellbent on destruction. They arrive from the plane of Xoriat, the Plane of Madness. No mortal in Khorvaire has ever been able to grasp their ways, and since the Daelkyr Wars that destroyed the Dhakani Empire, the Gatekeepers have been watching for any incursions from Xoriat. They lock any portals or manifest zones as soon as they appear, and watch over the portals. This is the entire purpose of the Gatekeepers, and is why Thom reached out to Petr. He believes his friend was sent by the Daelkyr, coming through a portal or at the very least has been corrupted by Xoriat.

  

Petr relays the story Galen told them, about how the book they discovered was the cause of the corruption. He rules out the possibility that Rydia was sent from Daelkyr, saying that it doesn’t sound like it was of her free will, assuming she and Galen are telling the truth. Thom asks where this happened, Petr relaying that it was supposedly somewhere in Karrnath. Thom asks about the title of the book, but Petr doesn’t know. Thom explains that one of the more painful moments of the Gatekeepers was a couple of centuries ago. Someone stole a book from them, the Gatekeepers assuming this was an agent of the Blood of Vol. The Blood of Vol is a powerful religion from Karrnath, and the book was the founding tome of the Gatekeepers. It was written by Vvaraak, and also possibly acted as a gateway. Vvaraak became obsessed with the Daelkyr, wanting to ‘find a way out of the maze’. The whispers from the council meeting was that the book contained everything Vvarak knew about Xoriat, and it consumed her.

  

Thom says he has no idea why the Blood of Vol wants the book, but the soldiers that work for them are called the Emerald Claw - the same name the Gatekeepers use as a nickname for Vvaraak, the founder of their order. Thom fears that Rydia may have glimpsed into the Realm of Madness. Petr says it’s plausible, as she clearly went through something. Thom asks if she can control it, with Petr explaining it seems to depend on her emotions, as she tends to shift when under attack, and controlling it again after can take hours. She doesn’t talk much about it, but he’s noticed. Thom asks if he’s seen the book, Petr saying he hasn’t, assuming that since Rydia fell into a coma of some sort, they likely fled and left the book behind. Thom says if they assume this is an accident and Rydia has some sort of control, the council are likely to suggest Petr watches her, trying to find out more and keep the Gatekeepers informed of what he learns. He says if they could find the book, it would be a huge win. Likewise, any information he can get from Rydia on the Daelkyr and what they have planned would be valuable to the Gatekeepers.

  

Thom explains he retired a long time ago, but the group were spotted in Gatherhold, someone apparently having seen Petr transform. The council started to ask if anyone knew the person in question, Thom enquiring after Petr. Thom says he has no intention of getting dragged back into this, but asks if Petr can hear the council out when they meet later that day. He doubts the council will be violent to begin with, more likely to want more information. Petr says he’s just happy to see Thom again, and the trip was worth it for that. Petr then asks Thom to take a look at the cake Rydia made, suspicious of the fact she made him something when he said he was going to visit his mother. Too nervous to try any, Petr opens the box and shows the cake to Thom, which is inscribed with ‘For Petr’s mom’. Thom can’t sense anything magical about the cake, saying that it seems to be perfectly fine, although a little stale. Petr tries some, which is delicious, although slightly old. “Maybe she really isn’t that bad,” Petr suggests, expressing that it’s possible Rydia could yet be saved. Thom and Petr sit in the Observatory, sharing the cake between them.

  

Meanwhile, having spent a few days researching in the library and seeing more of Korranberg, the remainder of the group eventually reconvene on the airship. Gathering together, Rydia presents a batch of smaller cakes for them all, which they begin to eat as they talk. Lux explains that she and Bonzobur were approached by someone from House Lyrandar who had a job for them. They discuss the offer for a while, discussing the idea of getting a bound elemental for the ship, but ultimately agreeing that doing something illegal in a place like Korranberg would probably be a bad idea. Lux asks whether or not they should turn him into the authorities, although there’s some concern that might cause a fuss with House Lyrandar. Galen offers to try and find out more about Ivello, as he has a contact in the House he could write to. The group agree to wait and see what Galen’s contact has to say, whilst Lux will send a message to Ivello declining his offer, and avoiding the group being seen with him again.

  

Lux shifts herself to look like Ivello as Galen sets about writing a letter, describing Ivello and asking if his contact knows who he is and why he would be in Korranberg. He avoids mentioning the job offer, eventually finishing off the letter and dropping it off at House Sivis. Lux also sends a letter of rejection to Ivello.

  

The next day, Galen receives a response from his contact in House Lyrandar, Esme. She recognises the description, although according to her the tattoos are new. After doing some research, she discovered that Ivello used to run one of the galleons for House Lyrandar, but it was eventually reported stolen. They suspected that Ivello joined a group of pirates in the Lhazaar Principalities, and is considered a rogue agent of the family. House Oriens and Lyrandar have a price out for his capture, with 1000 gold being offered if anyone can catch him. He’s been rumoured to be partnering with a pirate queen, Maia Roole, and the two of them being caught together would net a reward of 2500 gold. The letter continues on, with Esme happy to hear from Galen, telling him that not much has changed in Sharn, missing some of the antics they got up to. Galen writes a response, as well as sending a letter to his sister.

  

With their worries about House Lyrandar resolved, the group agree to hand Ivello into the Trust, although they don’t have much interest in bounty hunting themselves. Lux points out they might be able to get a cut of the 1000 gold if the Trust do catch him. There’s a chance Ivello might already have fled after Lux rejected his offer, but the group decide it’s worth trying anyway. Bonzobur suggests going to the Council of Nine to make the report, as well and see what jobs they have available for them to undertake.

  

Heading to the council buildings, there are a number of statues and decorations, a bound elemental atop one of the obelisks as above a door reads “Five words can defeat a thousand swords”. As the group arrive during open hours, there’s something of a crowd waiting to see the council, with a number of guards in the area. Waiting in line for some time, they are eventually shown into the main council chambers. There are two female gnomes present in the chambers, one younger with a darker complexion as the other appears to be older, with white hair. They sit slightly elevated from the floor, and nearby is a white haired older gentleman, not in one of the raised seat. The older woman greets them, asking what it is they came to ask about.

  

Lux explains they need to report a crime, as well as being interested in taking on some work for the Council. The gnome calls on the older man, Jodd, who sits up. His face is scarred, with half of it paralysed. Bonzobur recognises the man, who wears a sealed ring of the Architects, although he was removed from the organization - Jodd Uthar Jarell. He greets him, the two seemingly knowing each other from some time ago. Bonzo explains their meeting with Ivello, Jodd asking for a name and a place where they can find him. Bonzo gives him the name Ivello Neretti, and says he was staying at the Third King Inn. Jodd says he’ll look into it, sending some of the Trust to apprehend him. As he does so, Jodd grasps a glowing gem in his wheelchair, telepathically telling Bonzobur to come by his house tonight if he is interested in another assignment. Bonzo agrees to come visit later on.

  

The younger gnome then draws their attention, explaining they have a couple of open jobs that could use some capable sellswords. There have been some sightings of an undead creature in town, mostly by the riverside in Sivis Hill. There’s a purse of 450 gold for apprehending him, with an initial payment of 150 gold. Secondly, there’s an issue with the Calantar family - the Council have sent many people over to their estate, but haven’t had a response. They’d like some muscle to check the place out, with a purse of 2500 gold for completion, with 1250 being paid upfront. Both requests require a Sentinel from the Council to escort the group, so that the Council know everything they do is above board.

  

Lux consults with the group on the jobs, Galen asking how much money they need. Lux and Bonzobur mention trying to fund purchasing an elemental, as this was extremely expensive, running into multiple thousands. In the interest of trying to raise funds a little faster, they agree to take the Calantar job. The gnome snaps her fingers, a man stepping forward bearing the Mark of the Sentinel - he’s exceptionally tall and well built, wearing half plate armour.. He introduces himself as Garreth, explaining he’ll come with them to ensure they don’t run off with the initial stipend. The gnome writes Garreth a note for the quartermaster, Garreth then asking what they’re waiting for before telling the group to follow him to the quartermaster. Trailing after him, Jodd eyes the group as they leave to collect their payment.

  

Heading to the Calantar manor, they go to the more upperclass district of town, finding a large estate with a well kept front lawn and a large ironwrought fence around the outside, whilst the front facade is made of white marble. Lux asks what the plan is and if they should just knock, Rydia pointing out that’s the polite thing to do. As they’re outside, Rydia gives the box of silver bullets to Galen before heading to knock on the door. The door falls open as she does so, revealing a grand white marble entrance, with mosaics on the ceiling and an eternal flame spell hanging above the hallway. There’s a number of doors leading off the entranceway. Galen joins Rydia as she calls out into the foyer. “Concerned citizens, we’re coming in.” She turns to Garreth, asking if they’re allowed to head inside. Garreth says he’s just here to do his job and watch them, and if they get themselves killed he’ll report it to the council. Taking that as confirmation, Rydia heads inside, followed by the rest of the group.

  

Lux casts Detect Magic as they walk inside, reaching for her shoulder as she does so. The eternal flame is magical, but nothing else of note shows up in the entrance. Galen takes a look around the space, which appears to be spotless, as if cleaned by magic.

  

Heading further into the home, they find a sitting area as well as a portrait gallery, lined with images of various gnomes. Lux lights a torch as they move into the dark hallway, finding a room with a number of masks on the walls, lined with gold and feathers. There’s a layer of dust on everything, and a door that leads into a much bigger space that is much more well lit. It has a glass roof, with a number of vines growing across and into the room. This appears to be a cloakroom that leads onto a ballroom, the light breaking through the greenery to bathe the room in a soft light. Rydia inspects the masks as Lux moves towards one of the portraits in the other room, detecting something magical in the space. Moving the portrait aside, she finds a vault, which appears to have been magically locked. The vault appears to be intact, although it bears the sigil of House Kundarak.

  

Galen hears something from the ballroom, heading into the room to see if he can find the source, although he’s unable to spot anything. There’s a small door on the other side to the Mud Room, as well as a sundeck which is visible through the deck and the overgrowth. It doesn’t seem to be in good condition.

  

Lux asks how long the Council have been sending groups here, Garreth saying the last group were sent a couple of months ago. The last investigators didn’t return, hence the need to send another group. The overgrowth should have taken years, unless it was helped along by magic. Galen heads to check the sundeck, joined by Bonzobur. The deck is overgrown and broken, opening onto a much larger lawn. The grass is much higher, with wildflowers growing. As Galen steps outside, he spots a rhino on the lawn, stopping Bonzo before he can go any further. The two slowly back inside, leaving the animal well alone before it can spot them.

  

Galen informs the party of what they found, Lux questioning if that’s normal, given that fancy rich people can be known to have fancy pets. The group agree the rhino likely isn’t what caused this place to be abandoned, but it’s likely safer to leave the animal alone and investigate the house further. Lux leads the way towards the dining room, the table set for eight and in an equally overgrown state. The dining room opens up into the kitchen, which is completely tossed, with a number of dishes piled up in large stacks and rotting food lying around the place. Galen points out the entrance was immaculate, Lux theorising that someone is only cleaning the parts of the house that are visible to the outside.

  

As they walk around, Galen remembers that the Calantar family specialise in gem mining, and his father might have business with them, the gems used for enchantments. The Calantar family have a couple of mines, Galen moving off to look for a library to confirm his suspicions. As he moves through the house, the hall is caked in mud, with barefoot tracks visible in the dirt. He follows them into an office which is in disarray, Galen noticing one of the drawers in the desk is slightly open. He finds a small book in the drawer, which has clearly been used, but appears to be blank. Realising this is likely illusory script, Galen asks if anyone can break the enchantment. Bonzobur offers to spend some time to figure out if it’s magical, sitting down at the desk to cast Detect Magic.

  

Galen goes through the rest of the office, finding reports on yields from the mines, even finding some contracts between the Calantars and his father. Roughly two years ago, all the correspondence stops, with no more reports or documentation in the office. It seems the place has been abandoned for a while. There are various books that chronicle the history of the family Calantar of House Harlian. They dealt mostly in gems, and the latest generation had a single daughter, who was given a zoo as a child, with various details on the feeding schedule and purchase orders for animals such as an elephant, crocodile and a rhino. The girl, Randala seemed to love nature, her father buying her a zoo.

  

Galen asks Garreth how long this has been going on for, mentioning the documents stop two years ago. This comes as something of a surprise, as someone has been answering the door and assuring them everything is fine until a couple of months ago. Bonzobur completes his spell, seeing phrases in Gnomish which have been crossed out, other than one on the last page - “Diamonds scatter light best on a clear day”. All of the other phrases are also vague eight word statements. Bonzo and Galen realise that there are a number of House Kundarak vaults that require phrases like this, the group agreeing to go and try the phrase on the vault in the portrait gallery.

  

Doing so, the magical aura around the vault fades away. Galen offers to see if he can get the vault open, the lock popping open after a few moments. Inside, he finds a gold ring, a group of seven gems and a small corked bottle with a label from the Zilargo Alchemist Society. The ring and the bottle appear to be magical, the ring with abjuration and bottle of transmutation. The gems are a carnelian, three citrines and three small diamonds, which would be worth approximately 1850 gold. The group ask Garreth if they’re allowed to take what they found, Garreth agreeing as long as he gets a share. Bonzobur offers to identify the ring and the bottle later once they get a chance.

  

Returning to check the rooms they haven’t been to yet, Galen opens one of the doors onto a large library, although most of the books are strewn across the floor and waterlogged. Three hyenas are asleep in the corner, with bones scattered across the floor as well as the books. Galen backs out of the room, informing the group of what he found, theorising that the zoo seems to have taken over the house, although someone kept answering the door. Galen volunteers to go first and try to be quiet about it, to avoid drawing attention from the animals.

  

Opening the next door, they find a chapel which is completely trashed, the stained glass windows smeared with shit. There’s a large tree in the middle of the room, the tree etched with a symbol Galen recognises from the tomb where he and Rydia found the book - the symbol of Vvaraak. Galen carefully heads inside, investigating the tree, which seems to have sprouted out of the ground as if by magic. The symbol has been scratched into the tree with a dagger, stained with blood which appears to be at least a year old. There’s nothing magical, although Galen says the symbol on the tree is a bad sign. Rydia’s eyes drop to the floor as Lux asks what the symbol means. Galen says it’s bad news, Lux asking where Galen’s seen it before. Galen refers back to their dinner conversation before Rydia suggests they keep moving, which Galen quickly does.

  

Opening another set of doors, there’s a piano in the middle which is snapped in two, a number of rodents inside. There’s patio doors which have been blow open, and a group of eight monkeys are just outside. Galen backs away again, careful not to disturb the monkeys as he tries another door, finding a bar of sorts, although most of the bottles are gone. There’s a few loose floorboards, roots having grown up through the floor. Galen returns to the rest of the party in the hall, relaying what he found. With no more obvious doors, they backtrack through the house, locating stairs leading to the upper floor.

  

Heading upstairs, they open the doors onto a large master bedroom, which appears to have been abandoned. The bedrooms has an open set of doors leading to an ensuite, with windows overlooking the garden. There’s a smaller closed door, which Galen starts to move towards before hearing a large scattering of glass through another door. Galen slowly opens the door, finding himself on a balcony overlooking the ballroom. Downstairs, the rhinoceros is inside, with a gnomish woman riding it, half a ram’s skull over her face as a mask. She’s covered in painted markings, and surrounded by a swarm of locusts. She doesn’t seem to notice them, asking the rhino where he saw them.

  

Leaning back, Galen whispers that he found who was answering the door. Briefly deciding what to do, Galen asks Garreth what the aim of the mission was, eventually suggesting they go ask the woman what’s going on. It’s suggested that Lux does the talking, but as they debate this, they can hear something from the bathroom as a large crocodile begins to climb out of the bathtub.

  

Emerging onto the balcony, Galen calls down ‘concerned citizens’ to the woman, Randala. She says she was wondering when they would be sending new people by, Galen quickly telling her there’s been some horribly misunderstanding and they can leave her alone and report back to the council. Randala says the crocodile needs food, so she was rather hoping they would stay. She mutters to the rhino, wondering why they always fight back. “You really don’t want to do this darling, it’s not going to end well,” Galen tells her, Randala comforting the rhino for a moment before asking what he had in mind.

  

Galen suggests she call off her pets, although she says they’re wild animals that do what they want, however they might be inclined to help her if she needs it. She asks if the council sent them, which Galen confirms. Randala tells him to inform the Council everything is fine, Galen asking why she stopped answering the door. She insists she didn’t, people just kept wandering in. Randala seems to be completely insane, with a mad gleam in her eye, seemingly hellbent on destroying civilization. Galen suggests he just ask his friends to come downstairs and leave the crocodile alone, and Randala agrees, Galen calling to the party.

  

Lux heads downstairs, approaching Randala and the rhino as another creature lands in the ballroom - some sort of panther with tentacles emerging from it’s back - a displacer beast. The rhinoceros heads outside after Randala dismounts, leaving her alone in the ballroom. Garreth also heads downstairs into the ballroom as the crocodile climbs out of the bathtub, heading towards the bathroom where Rydia and Bonzobur are. Bonzobur draws his gun and readies himself for the approach of the crocodile. Rydia turns pale, the hair fading to white as all of her many eyes avoid the crocodile. She begins to back away slowly, however her shadow remains behind, a single eye opening on the shadow and looking at the crocodile. Tentacles slither across the ground towards it as the bathroom bursts into darkness, soft whispers and slurping noises emerging from the dark. Rydia’s shadow then slides along the ground to reconnect with her as normal.

  

Downstairs, Lux approaches Randala, asking if there’s anything she can do to make sure they keep talking. Randala asks if they can stop the attacks of every humanoid on mother nature. Lux says she’s not a god, so she can’t. “There are no gods.” Lux suggests they agree to disagree. “The prophetic dragon told me that there are no gods. It’s just us - our blood, every living creature on this planet. To cage them, mine them, keep pillaging from them is a slap in the face of the one we call Eberron.” Lux suggests this means it’s up to them to protect nature, Randala suggesting she’s doing something about that. Not just by killing people here, but by learning more about the words of the great prophet. Lux suggests she’d like to know more, Randala seemingly convinced. Lux asks if this means she’ll call off the beasts, Randala saying they do what they want, but the animals are already backing down a little. “The Emerald Claw teaches us about everything natural, and everything unnatural.”

  

At this point, Randala seems to notice what’s happening upstairs, the crocodile writhing in pain as it tries to escape from the bathroom to no avail. Randala shivers, turning into a bear as she roars out, seemingly feeling the attack on the crocodile. The bear attacks Lux as the ballroom bursts into combat, Galen taking a shot at Randala from the balcony as Bonzo comes towards the door to do the same. Rydia also heads out to the staircase, joining the assault on the bear, Lux doing her best to defend herself. The displacer beast leaps up the stairs towards Galen, wounding him with a tentacle.

  

Garreth rushes over to help Lux as the rhinoceros charges back into the ballroom, Garreth barely managing to toss her out of the way in time as it stampedes through the room. An elephant also joins in, moving towards Lux and Garreth. The crocodile eventually perishes in the darkness of the bathroom, Randala grabbing her head as it does so. Randala crumbles the balcony and the stairs, leaving Rydia clinging to a wall and Galen lying in the rubble as Randala turns into a giant ape. The group continue their assault on Randala as the displacer beast leaps at Galen, who manages to line up a shot on its neck, severely wounding it as it starts to bleed. For the second time, a strange blue energy erupts from Galen’s sternum, impacting the ape with something necrotic.

  

The party continue their attacks, Lux managing to narrowing avoid being trampled by an elephant as she forces the rhino to flee. Rydia rushes over to help Lux escape from under the elephant as Bonzo takes a shot at the displacer beast, finishing off the wounded creature as Randala is forced out of her ape form by attack from Garreth. Seeing the tide turn against her, Randala starts to flee as a wounded Galen pulls himself out of the rubble of the stairs, taking a shot at her. “I told you it would end badly for you,” Galen calls out, the shot taking her in the back as she falls to the ground. The elephant immediately lifts its feet, the monkeys that had been approaching beginning to retreat as the animals start to back away.

  

Wincing in pain, Galen says they need to stop getting into this, Lux agreeing as they gather themselves together. Rydia checks in with Galen, briefly inspecting his chest for the source of the blue light before they begin to search the remainder of the house. With some time, Bonzobur finds a compartment under the loose floorboards in the bar, uncovering a book. Leatherbound with two clasps, it doesn’t have the same weight, seemingly hollow with something rattling inside. Underneath the book is a leather pouch which contains 2180 gold in total, with some notes that can be redeemed at a Kundarak bank.

  

Bonzobur inspects the book, which doesn’t seem to be magical, but does contain a small pouch decorated with a symbol of water and a collection of wooden cylinders. Bonzo inspects the pouch, finding a dry powder which he realises is clay. Galen notices the ends of the cylinders have the symbol of Vvaraak, remembering that during his research, there was a book on Vvaraak constantly missing from the library. Realising they can roll the cylinders across the clay to reveal the contents of the book. Taking the time to make up the clay, Galen rolls out the cylinders. It tells the story of a couple of orc disciples who went with Vvaraak to Aeranal, where she met a male elf - the two had a child together called Erandis.

  

Meanwhile, considering his work done, Garreth heads out with his cut of the gems they found, leaving the group to consider what they do next.
