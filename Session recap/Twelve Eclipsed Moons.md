# Twelve Eclipsed Moons

  



  

A single gnome-ish woman has found her way up to the roof as well, making her way over towards Rydia. She sees her eating Ivello and calls out about this, trying to get the attention of the other gnomes of the Trust. Galen starts climbing up the roof after Rydia as Lux and Bonzo continue running inside, trying to reach the stairs they were told about.

  

Other gnomes are approaching, heading towards the woman who’s yelling about Rydia. As Galen reaches the top of the roof, he pulls the woman away from the roof a little, asking her to make less of a fuss. She points at Rydia, though Galen is unphased by what he sees Rydia doing. He tries to convince the gnome woman to let it go, but doesn’t really convince her.

  

“How dare you,” the woman says, before calling out to the others, telling them to bring the Gearkeepers, or at least the griffin riders. Rydia ignores most of what’s going on around her until Galen approaches her. As Galen does so, the woman gnome tries to stop him by casting Suggestion on him, but he shrugs off the spell and continues heading over to Rydia.

  

As he calls out Rydia’s name, Rydia instantly stops what she’s doing, standing up and looking down. “You okay?” he asks her, to which Rydia shakes her head.

  

In the building below them, Bonzo and Lux continue heading towards the stairs, Bonzo spotting a sign that says one of the stairs leads to the rooftop balconies. The staircase is gnome sized, so Lux quickly makes herself shrink by altering her appearance so both of them can easily climb the stairs. As they’re climbing up, they can see various guards arriving in the square, accompanied by massive rolling balls made of copper, bronze or gold.

  

Bonzo recognises them as Gearkeeper constructs, which he doesn’t think is a good sign. They’re fearsome constructs used to apprehend dangerous people. They quicken their pace, trying to get to the roof as fast as possible.

  

On the roof, Galen puts an arm around Rydia, who leans into him. As Galen looks over the body, he spots the same tattoo Rydia saw as well, but can’t read the script. There’s other tattoos and he also spots a shortsword at Ivello’s hip, though not wanting to cause any trouble, Galen doesn’t touch the evidence and simply stays there with Rydia.

  

The gnome-ish woman approaches them, revealing a holster of wands and pulling one out, aiming it at the both of them. “If you comply, maybe we can get out of this without too much bloodshed,” she says, to which Galen points out this is a misunderstanding, saying his friends are under way and they’ll explain everything. “I know what I saw, she was eating that man.” She adds that cannibalism is still very illegal, before saying she also doesn’t know what the hell Rydia is even supposed to be.

  

Galen points out that this man they just captured is a legendary criminal, but the gnome woman seems rather too focused on Rydia. At that point, Lux and Bonzo pile out onto the roof as well, Lux asking if everything is okay. Galen tells the two of them that he was just explaining to this lovely gnome lady that they would come help explain the situation and confirm everything is fine, Lux quickly jumping in on that.

  

“You mean the situation in which we apprehended the dangerous criminal the Council wanted?” she asks, which Galen confirms. “Yes, the one with the thousand gold bounty, because he’s such a highly wanted individual that we’ve taken care of for you.” Lux asks what the confusion is about, Galen telling him that there’s some confusion about them breaking the rules somehow.

  

Their tagteaming seems to convince the gnome somewhat, who lowers her wand and then whistles, two griffins with gnomes riding on them landing a couple dozen away from everyone. The two new gnomes dismount their griffins, the older one addressing the group. He asks what the problem is, Lux telling him she doesn’t think there’s a problem, as all they did was apprehend a criminal for them. The gnome-ish woman nods, confirming their story.

  

The older gnome asks if it’s alright the Trust takes over, after which Lux asks about their reward and Galen points out who exactly Ivello is. The gnomes say they’ll look into things and if this checks out, they’ll be in touch again later about the potential reward. Lux tells them they’re docked at the Skyport, and the gnomes can find them at the Heritage later.

  

After everyone climbs back down from the roof, the Trust takes the group’s statements before they’re asked to wait aboard the Heritage, which they do. It’s Nelson, the dock master, who comes to find them a little later, with a message from the Trust, telling them that they’ll be given a 500gld reward for apprehending Ivello, some money having been deducted for structural damage.

  

Lux makes sure to hide the Dream Lily as soon as they’re back on the ship.

  

Meanwhile, a few days earlier, Petr finds himself at the Gatekeepers meeting. He and Thom have taken the late afternoon to catch up, after which more and more Gatekeepers start showing up at the observatory. They all seem very friendly.

  

As the gathering gets underway, a half-orc man in a red robe starts the meeting. He’s older of age, with a large gash on his lip with one milky white eye, patches of his armor are completely covered in moss, with beatles living in it. He then has a small bird fly up to the largest of the spires in this area, before a light comes down from that spire, cascading down and reflecting on the various reflective surfaces on the ground.

  

This reveals an entire story in glyph images that are illuminated with this moonlight. It depicts the struggles of the Gatekeepers with the various Daelkyr. There’s battles, as well as imagery of them being killed and locked up. In further columns it shows various markers and places where these gates seem to have opened up at. The entire group tells Petr the story again of why they believe Rydia is at least touched by something from Xoriat and the half-orc man eventually approaches Petr.

  

“Your old colleague, Thom, he laid down his staff for the Gatekeepers a long time ago. While it seemed at the time that interaction with the Daelkyr was dwindling, losing steam so to speak, it seems that now that activity has started to rekindle. I’d like you to act in his place, if you’re up for it, and if you’re interested,” the man says. Petr tells the half-orc that Thom took him on as his apprentice about ten years ago, and that it would only make sense for him to follow in Thom’s footsteps. He accepts.

  

The half-orc waves somebody over, who comes over with a staff. Even in the pale moonlight Petr can see that the staff has a strange ‘7’ shape, with various branches growing on it. The leaves are sickly green, fresh spring leaves. “This was Thom’s staff, it is in itself a key to one of the gates,” the half-orc explains, walking over to one of the pillars and pointing out one of the illuminated glyphs; an image of a crumbling keep, half sinking into a swap. “This is the Tzaryan Keep, it is in a wilder region of Khorvaire. You do not need to be near it, to carry its key. But the key needs to remain safe with you. If there’s ever a problem, if it ever gets lost, you need to contact us immediately, do you understand?”

  

Petr says he does understand, but asks how he can contact them. The half-orc says they’ll teach him how to communicate with animals, which is how they tend to communicate.

  

“Please let us know if there’s any development in your friend’s condition,” the half-orc then says, Petr confirming that he should just keep an eye on her and gain her trust. “If what you told us is correct, then she isn’t the immediate threat we thought she was,” the half-orc confirms. “Even better, we might be able to learn something through her connection with the Daelkyr. Like what their next plan is going to be, where they are operating out of, things like that.” Petr promises to keep his eyes open and that he will try to learn as much as he can.

  

He hands Petr the Staff of Four Seasons, before telling Petr that the Gatekeepers meet here every new moon, and that if there’s anything he wishes to tell them in private, he can find them here. Davead, who only then introduces himself, also tells Petr that, in case of emergency, a Sending spell through house Sivis works as well.

  

With the meeting over, there’s some idle chit-chat amongst people and Petr seeks out Thom again. “The staff fits you, that’s good,” Thom says, Petr thanking him for letting him have it. The two of them agree to have one last drink before Petr has to head back.

  

The following morning, Petr awakes to most of the Gatekeepers having already left this place. He packs up his own things before heading back to Passage, where he seeks out the captain. Fianin tells him she’s not ready to head back yet. She tells him she hopes that Beck will take care of her duties in the meantime, and apologises profusely. “If there’s anything I can help you with, from up here, then please let me know, but I’ve missed Shivaro a lot, more than I’d like to admit. The amount of trouble we’ve been getting into recently … I’m just so tired of it.”

  

Petr tells here there’s no need for her to apologise, assuring her they’ll take care of each other and of the ship. “We’ll see you when you’re ready to join us again.” She wishes him good luck, and Petr then continues on his journey, eventually finding his way back to Korranberg.

  

Meanwhile, back on the ship, Galen makes Rydia the worst cup of tea in the world and seeks her out. That same day, Bonzo heads to the post office, sending a letter to the other Architects. The letter reads:

  

Fellow Architects,

  

Jodd on Council of Nine in Korranberg. Continuing plans reviving Kennrun with necromancy for Karnathy King. Help me stop him. Please reply.

  

BBB

  

Galen asks Rydia if she’s feeling better, which she says she is. She takes the tea, recoiling for a moment before drinking from it anyway, appreciating the gesture. “Can’t be worse than people,” she points out when Galen asks if it’s terrible, after which Galen asks if she wants to talk about what happened.

  

She at first simply confirms the tea is indeed terrible, before saying she knows that’s not what Galen meant. “If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine, but if you do …” Rydia asks why not talking about it is fine, to which Galen says that he doesn’t want to push her into talking about something she doesn’t want to talk about.

  

“Am I a monster?” Rydia asks, which Galen instantly denies. “What if I want to be?” Rydia admits that she thinks being a monster might make some things easier. “Easier doesn’t mean it’s the right thing,” Galen points out and Rydia asks him to tell her what the right thing is, handing him the two letters she picked up from the post office earlier.

  

Galen reads the letters and Rydia goes on, saying she thinks it’s easier for everyone, especially her family, if Rydia is dead, and she really is just Damned. “You want to let them think you’re dead,” Galen asks, to which Rydia says she’s open to alternatives, suggesting Beck could pose as her.

  

“Did Rydia die?” Galen then asks, to which Rydia says she doesn’t know, and maybe she did. “Where you start, doesn’t have to be where you finish,” Galen tells her, telling her she can call herself whatever she wants, and do whatever she wants with this, but he’s still gonna be there. He does also say that he thinks it’s worse to let her family know nothing. “So you’re saying I should write back?” Rydia asks, to which Galen simply says that, if someone he loved disappeared, he’d want to know what happened, whether it’s bad or good.

  

Rydia suggests that, if she tells them what happened, they’re probably goint to come and kill Galen, but he’s not suggesting she tell them the truth; just tell them something. She can either write them now, or can wait til they inevitably write to him instead, and he can tell them whatever she wants them to tell him. “But if you want me to tell them you died, you can’t come back from that, there’s no going home. So you gotta be sure.”

  

Rydia says she’s not sure she’s not dead, to which Galen points out she’s talking to him, which makes her seem pretty alive. They continue discussing what to do, Rydia suggesting she tell them ‘something’ happened and they’re trying to fix it, which prompts Galen to ask if she wants to fix it in the first place.

  

Chuckling, Rydia points out that at this point that means she’s Rydia, but she ate people, so she doesn’t know. “Galen, monsters eat people,” she points out, which Galen corrects to monsters killing people, saying he’s done that quite a lot. “In fact, I seem to have a talent for getting people I care about killed, or whatever you want to call this.”

  

When Rydia asks if he’s saying they’re both monsters, Galen simply says the world isn’t as black and white as that, pointing out Ivello wasn’t exactly a good person either. Despite what’s going on with her, Rydia has never done what Ivello did to anyone, or at least not to anyone who didn’t deserve it.

  

Rydia admits that when she thinks about what she does or did, she feels ashamed, scared of herself. “But when you name the names of the ones I did it to, I feel like they deserved it.” Galen ignores the fact that the last bit of that sentence came out in draconic, instead telling Rydia that the day she goes too far, he’ll be there to pull her back. The two of them hug and Rydia thanks Galen.

  

Petr returns, the others having fully stocked the ship whilst awaiting his arrival. Galen asks Petr how his mom’s doing, to which Petr says she’s doing great and she sends her regards. He tells them he met up with some friends as well, offering the group some candy he brought back with him. Galen asks about the captain, so Petr relays Fianin’s message, telling the others she’s going to lay low for a while.

  

With everyone aboard the ship, they discuss where to go next, mostly confirming they’re still hoping to head to Q’barra. Galen shares he has something personal he needs to check out there, so he suggests that they go to New Throne, as he has to look into something for his dad there.

  

They get ready to leave, everyone finishing up around town. Lux tells Petr about their new elemental, familiarizing Petr with it, considering he’s the pilot. Bonzo makes sure to head by his family, saying his good-byes to his mother and his siblings, who send him on his way with a grand total of seven pies.

  

Before they head out, Lux heads down to pay the dock fees and as she does so, she’s told that a halfling dropped by a note for Bonzo. Lux takes the note, a folded piece of paper with a blank seal on it. She pays the fees and then heads back up to the ship and they set out to New Throne.

  

As soon as they’re underway, Lux changes back to Beck, and he seeks out Bonzo, handing him the note, telling him it was handed of by a halfling. Bonzo notes that most halflings come from the Talenta Plains, then opens the note and reads it. It simply says: “I know who you are, Ashbringer.” He doesn’t know who the note exactly is from, not recognizing the handwriting.

  

Travel that day is uneventful. Rydia finds Galen, showing him something she wrote, which Galen reads, then telling her she should go ahead and send it.

  

Beck and Petr take the time to catch up, Petr telling Beck about everything that happened on his trip. Petr says his trip went better than expected, admitting he was a little scared of what they might want from him. “They told me that Rydia is probably touched by something out of a dimension called Xoriat and after going back and forth and laying down theories we kind of came to the conclusion that we don’t think Rydia herself is evil, it’s just that she was just touched by something that has changed her against her will.” He goes on to say that they recruited him into the Gatekeepers and that he has to keep an eye on her, gain her trust and see if he can find out more information about the book.

  

“The actual book was written by Vvaraak, the founder of the Gatekeepers, and there’s this group called the Blood of Vol and the Emerald Claw who are after the book, which is a bad thing.” Petr continues summarising what happened, mentioning Thom as well as the awesome staff he was given.

  

Beck offers that the book is called the Tome of Vvaraak, which Galen shared with him earlier that week. “Galen’s done a lot of research on this; they’ve been trying to figure out what happened,” Beck shares, adding that as far as he knows, the others don’t know where the book is either. Petr says he assumes Rydia and Galen didn’t take the book when they encountered it, Beck saying he assumes the same. Changing the subject briefly, Petr talks about the captain, assuring Beck she’s doing okay, and she just needs to rest up.

  

Petr points out that Galen seemed keen to go to New Throne, asking if Beck knows anything about that place. “I think there’s a lot of people from Cyre there,” Beck says, though he doesn’t know much more about the place. They agree that it sounds like an interesting place.

  

Beck then says that, now that Petr’s back, he still kind of wants to try the Dream Lily. They agree to do it that evening, Petr talking Beck through some preparations they can take. Before they get ready, Beck goes out onto the deck to find Galen.

  

“I’m gonna be making questionable decisions tonight, so I figured now is a good time to promote you to first mate,” Beck says as he walks up to Galen, which seems to surprise Galen. “Are you sure you’re not making a questionable decision right now?” Galen asks, which Beck confirms he doesn’t think he’s doing. Rydia chuckles, which Beck takes as a sign that Rydia thinks this is a great idea.

  

Before Galen can really say no (or yes), Bonzo’s already getting pies to celebrate. “We’re supposed to be passengers..” Galen objects, though Beck points out they’ve already been more involved than that. Galen then thanks him, before asking about the questionable decision.

  

“I’m gonna try and use the Dream Lily to see if we can look around Metrol,” Beck then admits, which Galen says he’s going to stay away from. Rydia offers to keep an eye on them as this happens, which Beck appreciates, but Petr is already going to do that. “It’ll be fine,” Rydia says, which clearly it will be.

  

As Petr and Beck head below deck to set up, Galen turns to Bonzo, asking him to teach him how to fly the ship. “Alright, don’t touch this button, don’t touch that button, …” he says, as Rydia says she’ll just start preparing some food for after the drugs. Petr tells her that she should definitely make some omelettes, which Rydia does.

  

Retreating down below, Beck retrieves some of the Dream Lily from the interdimensional closet, handing it to Petr, who uses it to prepare a pipe. He advises Beck to lie down after he inhales, which he does. As Beck closes his eyes, he starts noticing a rough wind that picks up around him.

  

He finds himself surrounded by a thick yellow haze, recognising the location despite this haze: the banks of Starmantle Bay. He knows this used to provide a breathtaking view of the seven Vermishards, but his sight now doesn’t reach further than a hundred feet. He can still see the shapes of the vermishards and the water in the bay has an eerie blue glow as the wind continues to whistle around him.

  

Trying not to linger on the familiarity, Beck tries to head directly to the train station, which he knows to be on the outskirts of town; between the Vermishard of Blood (containing the kennels of House Vadalis) and the Vermishard of Steel (containing the palaces of House Cannith).

  

As he walks through the empty streets, he gets the feeling he’s being watched, though he’s unable to pinpoint where from; it feels like an omnipresent thing. Veering off the path a bit, he recognises the beginning of the street he used to live on. He sees a silhouette in the mist there, a hint of gleaming platemail, but he can’t make out any more details.

  

He keeps heading towards the train station, passing by what looks like a massive warforged, slumped against one of the Vermishards. Walking along the north shore, he spots the Court of the Unicorn in the distance, which he knows houses the train station and various other House Orien buildings.

  

What used to be a beautiful plaza now lies in shambles; all the trees are dead, some collapsed into neighborhood buildings. There used to be a fountain, featuring galloping water horses, there’s now just brackish water. He sees the station up ahead, the golden unicorn atop faded and the windows broken. There’s a whizzing sound; the clocks on lantern posts still ticking, despite their glass having been smashed.

  

Unsure where the first stone was laid, Beck keeps approaching when he suddenly feels a pounding in his chest. He soon realises its coming from the amulet around his neck, opening it when he hears the sound is coming from inside it. As he opens it, he doesn’t see the familiar animation of his family smiling warmly at him; he instead sees his wife and daughter in absolute terror, pounding on the glass of the hangar, begging, as the background fills with yellow mist.

  

Beck tries to break the glass of the amulet, eventually managing to do so, making the animation in the amulet fade. Taking a breath, he tries to focus back on why he’s here, pushing forward and trying to find the oldest part of the building, where he assumes the first stone would be.

  

Having watched some of the lightning rail being constructed, he has a decent idea of where to start looking, eventually finding what he’s looking for in the main building. He finds a part of the building where he can see a plaque, describing the first brick was laid there. The plaque itself is smashed, lying in broken pieces on the ground, with behind it a small compartment that seems to be empty.

  

Beck casts Detect Magic to try and double check nothing magical got left behind, but doesn’t pick up on anything, concluding the compartment is empty and someone beat him to it.

  

As he looks up, the silhouette he saw before is now twenty feet away from him. He can see it’s an elven woman with long black hair, who carries a long sword. She has the bearing of royalty yet there’s a tremendous sorrow about her and she’s clearly staring at Beck. Assuming it might be either Jonhanna or Aubrey, Beck calls out their names, but the figure doesn’t respond to either name.

  

“Can I help you with anything?” he then asks, and the figure steps closer, revealing frozen tears running down her cheeks. Beck recognises her face then, from various Cyrian coinage; this is Athelonia, the former Queen to the old King before the Last War broke out. She’s wearing beautiful royal looking platemail, even though it looks somewhat dirty. She looks at Beck and then speaks. “Your friends arrived here just before you did.”

  

Beck asks what she means by his friends, to which she elaborates by saying she means those from the house. “You can’t hide from Teraza’s Eyes. She will reveal this great tragedy for once and for all. She will unmask you and your entire fucking house. And when she does a quick death from the mist’s heart will be all you can hope for in this world.”

  

She snarls as Beck confirms she means those belonging to House Cannith, after which he tells her he’s not exactly on speaking terms with them right now. “I’m also not trying to hide,” he adds, seemingly convincing her he’s speaking the truth. She says she’s seen him walk up to their palaces many times; that she’s seen this entire city move like an anthill. Beck says that was before.

  

“That was before? Where has that loyalty gone? And why are you here, then?” Beck explains that someone he used to consider a friend belongs to House Cannith, and that he thinks this person is not the right person to be in possession of whatever this is. “I’m afraid he’s already got it.” Beck voices his concern with that, as Athelonia asks him where he’s heading now.

  

He tells her he’s going to Q’barra. “Interesting. Then we’ll see each other soon,” she says, before vanishing into the mist.

  

Unsure how much time he has left here, Beck tries to make his way to his old house. He walks up the Vermishard of Steel, reaching his street and recognising his house. It’s immediately recognisable, yet also feels off. The trees that used to blossom richly are now dead spikes, all the windows of his home have been shattered.

  

He goes inside, opening the door, finding the walls covered with thousands of pieces of black and purple funghi, glistening orbs that seem to open up as he walks by, almost as if they’re watching him. Heading upstairs, he finds his daughter’s room, which is in relatively perfect condition bar a shattered window.

  

Reaching for his amulet, he sits down, says a prayer to Olladra and waits out his time. It takes an uncomfortable amount of time before he returns back to reality.

  

Petr, who’s been sitting by Beck’s side throughout all of this, only noticed him trying to cast a spell, but nothing else weird happened. He offers Beck some water and some food as Beck tells him what he saw. He tells Petr that Jonah already got there, and that Queen Athelonia appeared to him.

  

Almost everyone is familiar with Queen Athelonia. She was married to the old king, Jarrod, the King of Galifar. Their five children started a war for the throne when he died, which led to the Last War. Jarrod was a human, she was an elf. Both Petr and Beck also know that she as a mother saw her children fight and wage war, but she also guided her daughter, the Queen of Cyre, and in her opinion the true heir, through her tears. She told her to murder her other children, which is why she’s also called the Eclipse of the Twelve Moons.

  

“She said she’d see me soon, after I told her we’re going to Q’barra,” Beck adds, though neither of them really know what to make of that. When Petr asks if Beck thinks it was real, Beck simply says that it felt real to him.

  

“Guess there’s only one way to find out,” Petr points out, which Beck agrees to. He then asks Beck if he’s feeling okay, to which Beck admits he made the mistake of going to his old house, which didn’t make him feel particularly good. Petr suggests food and a stiff drink to make them feel better, which Beck agrees to.

  

As they walk back up to grab said food and drink, Beck checks his amulet, finding it back to normal.

  

The following day, both Beck and Petr have to catch up on some sleep, which leaves Galen, Rydia and Bonzo in charge of the ship. Galen, at the helm, suddenly feels like the ship is beginning to climb. He calls out to Bonzo, the two of them trying to figure out what’s happening as the ship starts climbing more and more, throwing everyone around.

  

Bonzo and Galen manage to catch themselves as Rydia gets bombarded with soup and cooking equipment, Beck and Petr being thrown around their sleeping quarters as well. Bonzo soon realises that it’s likely something wrong with the vertical rudder and he goes below deck to try and fix it.

  

There, he finds that ice has started gathering around the vertical rudder and through a clever use of Heat Metal, he manages to get rid of the ice, which allows Galen to even out the ship again. Heading back above deck, Bonzo checks in with Galen, asking him for permission to make some more permanent fixes to the rudder to stop this happening again, which he thinks Galen can now give him permission for, considering he’s first mate now.

  

Galen tells him to go ahead, muttering about how he’s working through some things, so Bonzo gets to work. Galen is left at the helm, head in his hands, wondering what he signed up for.

  

The following day, they fly over Kraken Bay, onto Valenar, with the jungle in view on their east. Halfway through the day, they come across a widely spaced out city, the entire city surrounded by a living wall of bronzewood thorn. They know they’re flying over Taer Valestas, the elven capital of Valenar. They can see massive groups of cavalry riding through it’s broad streets as they glide past it, eventually reaching Adder Bay by evening.

  

Their last day of travel is slowed by strong head winds. As they pass over Adder Bay, Beck is the only one who spots a strange ship with no sails. It seems to be quite old, and abandoned, just drifting in the waves. Though noting this is odd, they continue on their travels, eventually arriving in New Throne around midnight.

  

As the Heritage glides in, the first indication of there being land here is a massive cloud of dirt in the water. The water changes color from blue to deep, murky brown and eventually they see a very wide river, with a castle on one side and a smaller town on the other, narrowing into the mouth of the Adder River. The cloud of murky brown is the debris that the river is throwing into the ocean.

  

Compared to Korranberg, the city of New Throne is not as brightly lit and they don’t instantly see any kind of port for them to dock the ship. They do see some docks and decide to lower their anchor near there, just a little ways away from the land.

  

Tired from a long day of travel, they decide to sleep on the airship. Beck takes first watch, not really noticing anything. Petr and Rydia both take over for second watch, with Rydia suddenly hearing a scream from beyond the walls, about a hundred feet away. Both her and Petr take a look, spotting a goblin being dragged around by what looks to be a gnoll.

  

Calling out in goblin, Rydia asks the goblin if he needs help, which the goblin confirms. The gnoll responds to this by smacking the goblin, which is all the proof Rydia needs to act; she reaches out and sends an Eldritch Blast at the gnoll. Petr can’t really see what’s going on, still preparing to fight, but it seems Rydia’s spell was enough to scare the gnoll off.

  

Both Petr and Rydia jump overboard, Petr casting Feather Fall to make them slowly drift down to the water. They swim to shore and meet up with the goblin, recognising Grekk as they get closer; the goblin advisor who works with Orryn. He asks them why they’re here, a question Petr instantly turns around on him, pointing out that Grekk already knew they were heading to Q’barra.

  

“I was taken by old Redfang there, against my will,” Grekk explains, gesturing in the direction the gnoll ran. He thanks the both of them for helping him, adding that it’s somewhat unexpected. He elaborates, saying that when the Daask left Gaterhold, they had some more tricks up their sleeve. He was taken by both Redfang and another mercenary, an orc they called Crowhunter.

  

“The thing is; they desperately wanted to know about a certain draconic prophecy. And I’m terribly sorry to tell you this, I sang like a canary,” Grekk admits, saying he told them they were coming here, that he told them about the Temple of Luminescent Blight; everything he discussed with Galen up front, he told them all of it. “Well if we know there’s gonna be a trap, it’s no longer a trap, is something the old Galen would say,” Rydia points out, before suggesting they continue this conversation aboard the ship, perhaps in the morning.

  

They head back, Grekk once again saying he’s glad they showed up.

  

The following morning, they get a proper view of the city of New Throne. Most of the buildings seem to be made up out of organic materials, making it look pretty in it’s own way, but perhaps somewhat primitive. There’s a messy layout of the city and it’s an explosion of color, with walls portraying murals, baskets of flowers, clay urns, drippy vines, and many more things.

  

The docks begin to come alive in the morning, with various minstrels walking around the city, playing for cash; it’s quite a lively city. With everyone now awake, they talk to Grekk, who tells the others the same thing he told Petr and Rydia the night before. Never having met each other before, Grekk and Bonzo introduce themselves to each other, Bonzo feeling like Grekk seems a little bit conniving.

  

When asked about why he was brought here, Grekk says they wanted to know where the group was heading, and they brought him along as collateral. He once again admits that he told them everything, which doesn’t please Galen. He apologises for having told them, before pointing out there’s only two of them.

  

Galen asks about what they were interested in, Grekk saying they seemed interested in the prophecy. Galen says a trap’s not a trap if you know it’s there, verbatim saying the line Rydia said the night before.

  

Grekk explains they moved on foot from Gatherhold to here, and that it seemed they were trying to find a guide through the jungle. “Redfang was dragging me out of their hiding place to go meet up with another guide,” Grekk explains, saying he doesn’t think they’ve left town yet. They were on their way to the Wandering Serpent, when Rydia interrupted them and freed Grekk.

  

They discuss whether or not they might be able to get a headstart by flying over the jungle, Grekk saying they might at least be able to fly to the city, even though he doesn’t know where the city is. Galen suggests they find out where the city is, Beck adding they apparently now know where to find a guide.

  

Grekk explains the city a little, saying the city is run by a couple of wealthy land owners. “The one in charge of the guides is called Rashida Talro'a,” Grekk says, but he’s not sure if Redfang went to meet with one of her guides specifically, he simply overheard a conversation. Rydia then asks about the laws in this town, Grekk saying the laws are very loose.

  

Grekk once again points out there’s only two of them, but he has heard them talking about others, and about potentially hiring some mercenaries. “Apparently there’s a Dhakaani regiment of hobgoblins in town, some bladebearers, that’s honestly all I know,” Grekk adds. Galen suggests they head into town; he’ll be able to check out his family issue and they might be able to find some other leads there as well.

  

Heading into town, they slowly become a little more familiar with the town layout after asking around. There’s a couple of inns and taverns for travelers; they hear about the Wandering Serpent (where the drinks are cheap), Turan’s Rest and Revelry (the only inn licensed by House Ghallanda) and the Gold Dragon Inn (a cheap knock-off of the Golden Dragon Inn, they’re advised to stay away from this place).

  

There’s a main market called the Red Bazaar, called that because of the dinosaur meat that hangs on hooks, the blood falling down onto the streets and running into the river. There’s a large public bathhouse and temple called Olladra’s Respite, there’s a shrine to Kol Korran, and then there’s the New Throne Depository.

  

They’re told to head to the depository, especially after Galen names Alternar’s Artefacts. The outer building is mainly made up out of mud, containing a couple of large windows. It has a soaring ceiling, to make it appear more grander than the rest of the buildings, and it has a few shops inside, as well as counters and tellers to the right.

  

Galen makes his way to the one called Altaner Artefcats, approaching the nervous looking man behind the counter, who’s wearing a name tag that says ‘Hi, I’m Tervan’. Galen introduces himself, saying he’s heard there’s been some trouble. “There’s been some irregularities,” Tervan says, but before he continues, he asks Galen for some sort of proof of identification.

  

Rydia reaches up from behind Galen, unbuttoning some of his shirt, explaining that’s the best proof that he is who he says he is. She steps back as Galen instead pulls his sister’s letter from his pocket, handing that to Tervan. He finds this sufficient proof and welcomes Galen, before explaining a little more about the situation.

  

“We’ve been trying to source local talent to go and have a look for us, but it seems that House Tharashk has … stopped abiding by our deals, because of some recent troubles they had,” Tervan explains. “House Tharashk is fairly powerful, especially here, and simply put, we can’t afford to lose their business. They’ve been hauling tremendous wealth out of this jungle, we would hate to see it evaporate.”

  

He glances at Galen’s gun, before he says that violence won’t solve this; diplomacy would be a better approach. Galen asks what kind of reputation he has, after which Tervan backtracks, claiming he just saw a gun and wanted to at least warn him. Galen summarises by saying the arrangement with the Tharashk’s was messed up and it needs to be fixed.

  

“They do not wish to speak with us anymore, they say they have bigger fish to fry,” Tervan says, before confirming that essentially yes, that is what he’s asking. “Lumiz d'Tharashk is our contact with the house, if you’re interested,” Tervan continues, before telling Galen where they can find her. It’s the biggest house that’s technically outside of the city; they can’t miss it.

  

Galen then takes the opportunity to ask about a potential guide of the area. Tervan mentions the guides that can be found in the Wandering Serpent, as well as Rashida herself, then also mentions someone he knows: a dragonborn named Azaka. “You usually can find him in the Gold Dragon Inn. He’s kind of miserable, but once he’s sober, he knows most of the secrets of this land. He’s pointed us into many profitable directions.”

  

Thanking Tervan for the information, Galen excuses himself, turning to Beck to ask for his help with a negotiation situation. He explains that the shop is the family business, saying they lost a trade deal and he’s supposed to fix that. He points out the diplomacy thing, then asks if he looks like a violent person, which Beck denies.

  

Galen also shares there’s a few places they can check out for people who might be able to help them find the temple. Beck asks if they want to start by talking to the Tharashks, which Galen agrees is a good idea, so they all head out to find the Tharashk house. They can easily spot the large manor; it’s the single large house in the area.

  

It almost looks organic, built out of black stone with large columns; it seems a little like a strange building. They can see a garden in front of it as they arrive; the front door is open, and it seems to be gilded. It leads into an internal open space, with columns on all sides, a single palm tree in the center. There, they’re welcomed by a dark-skinned human man, wearing just some white pants, carrying a platter of various drinks.

  

Galen asks if they can speak to Lumiz d’Tharashk, and he promises he’ll go and inquire after he settles the drinks. He returns a few minutes later, telling them Lumiz will see them. “Remember, she is of noble blood, so please, pay your respects to her,” he reminds the group, before asking them to follow him.

  

He leads them through the beautifully decorated house, some of the vases around the house clearly draconic in origin, until he eventually opens a large stone door and lets them inside. From inside this chamber, steam is rising. Rydia casts Guidance on Galen, then is the only one who stays behind in the hallway as the rest of the group heads inside.

  

They walk into the room. There’s a small fountain in front of them, a large tiled seating area and the temperature in the room is very hot. Beyond the fountain is a room with a clear pool, with sunlight coming in from above; in the bath, covered in steam, sits a dark-skinned woman with long, cornrowed hair. She’s completely naked, her dragonmark clearly glowing on her shoulder as she welcomes the group and invites them in.
