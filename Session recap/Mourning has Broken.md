# Mourning has Broken...
Behind Yonhanna there are two large windows, through which the group can see a city. Beck recognises it with ease; this is Metrol, though it seems to be some sort of illusion. 

There’s a round table with six chairs, to which Yonhanna gestures as she offers the group some tea, a few of them hesitantly accepting the offer. The conversation is quick to turn to more serious matters, Beck asking what happened here. 

Yonhanna says that they would’ve succeeded if their mission hadn’t been tampered with. When Beck asks about what was said before by Gilaali, about how they will reverse what happened, Yonhanna says she’ll get to that later. 

First, she has some questions herself. She’s curious why they’re here, as people haven’t been to Making in a long time. When she’s asked some questions in turn, she explains about how some of the others here, the Inspired, have gone through lucid dreaming exercises, and she also mentions the palace the group came across before, saying it was just an exercise in lucid dreaming and of no real note. 

She then turns the attention back to the group, asking where they’re all from. Beck simply points out the illusionary windows, to which she apologises. The others tell her where they’re from as well, except Galen, who says he’s not sure why that’s relevant. 

When asked why she hasn’t reversed what happened yet, Yonhanna says that they’ve had to wait for Xoriat to get closer. She goes on to explain that she believes that if they can navigate the maze of Xoriat, that will help them reverse things. It will be close enough in a few days. 

They then ask her why she seems to still be alive. Yonhanna explains that the Inspired seem to be immune to the effects of the Mourning, and she and some others simply got lucky; being underground protected them from the brunt of the effects, though most of them have been worsening over time. 

She goes on to say that, four years ago, their dream cradles were all set and they thought nothing could go wrong. The mission was to contact Dal’Quor, and find a powerful Quori spirit who could grant them the effects of a Wish spell. It was meant to be a weapon of sorts. 

They thought nothing could go wrong, but it did. She says she was panicked and grief-stricken for almost a month before she started working on trying to reverse things. They found out in that time that someone had put dreamlily in the dream cradles, which is how they realised that their attempts had been sabotaged. They’ve since blocked all divination magic in the area. 

It was the sabotage that brought them down. Instead of contacting Dal’Quor, as intended, they wound up contacting Xoriat. She thinks Xoriat is now also the answer to fixing things, going on to explain that all mortals are linked to the different planes.

Rydia asks about the Sentinels of the Maze, Yonhanna saying that, if they can navigate the maze without the help of the Sentinels, they will succeed in their mission. Rydia, having seen the maze, thinks it’s highly unlikely they’ll succeed at this and Galen points out that there’s consequences to actions, and if Yonhanna thinks she can just turn back time to escape hers, it likely won’t work like that. 

As they’re all discussing this, everyone feels as if they’re being watched, but Bonzo doesn’t pick up on any presence when he uses Detect Magic in the room. An amulet that Yonhanna is wearing does glow, as does a wooden horse in the book case behind her. 

Beck then asks Yonhanna if she’s left here, to which she says she has been outside of Clawrift, but not outside of Making. She then asks the group if they were sent by anyone, specifically mentioning House Cannith, admitting that she thought they would send someone. Beck tells her that technically, House Cannith thinks they were the ones who sent the group. 

As the two are talking, Rydia sees Yonhanna from another angle, and is reminded of the woman she saw in the vat when they were making their way upstairs. The woman looked almost exactly like Yonhanna. When Rydia asks about this, Yonhanna admits that she’s been using the clone spell to help keep herself alive. 

She then asks Rydia about her contact with Xoriat, what it was like, to which Rydia explains that it’s indescribable; non-sensical yet somehow it still makes sense. Yonhanna says she relates. 

Considering they’re here for the crystal, Galen asks Yonhanna about it, but she doesn’t elaborate much, instead just saying that House Cannith can have it back in a few days. She further explains that in a few days, the planes of Eberron and Xoriat will be coterminous, which is when the dreamers will go into the dream cradles and try to navigate the maze. 

Rydia says that she thinks that’s a bad idea, mentioning the Coming, which seems to frustrate Yonhanna somewhat, who goes on to complain about religious zealots. She explains that the Inspired have religious rites as well, and they’re all connected to Dal’Quor. She then admits that she’s letting them believe that they’re trying to reconnect to Dal’Quor. 

Beck then asks if Yonhanna’s considered that going back in time will mean the war will still be going, to which Galen asks Yonhanna if she really thinks that this is going to work. She seems somewhat frustrated with Galen’s negativity and questions, so she tells him she won’t engage in that discussion, after which Galen excuses himself and steps out of the room. Rydia follows him. 

Bonzo urges Yonhanna to consider what Galen is saying, to which she says that she is convinced that it will work this time. The Inspired seem unaffected by the maddening effects of the maze and should therefore be able to navigate it. Bonzo and Beck continue talking to Yonhanna, attempting to understand her reasoning for doing all this. She mentions her wife, and wanting to get back to her. They once again remind her of the consequences.

Changing the subject, Bonzo then asks about the warforged, curious if Yonhanna knows anything more about them. She does, saying there’s a large camp to the east of Making. They’ve also captured some of her Inspired. She goes on to say that the warforged did not like any form of control, mentioning telepathy. They were collecting things.

When asked, she tells Bonzo that they do have two warforged here, who are here of their own volition after seeing the error of their ways. Bonzo asks to speak to them, which Yonhanna agrees to, sending someone to go get them. Yonhanna then excuses herself, leaving Petr, Bonzo and Beck in the room and passing by Rydia and Galen on the way out. 

Gesturing for the latter two to come back inside, Bonzo then points out the wooden horse to Galen, who does recognise the style from the wooden horse they stole on that train, except that one was much larger. 

Now that they’re alone, Rydia takes the chance to describe everything she saw on the way up here, Beck saying that he felt it when they crossed that large manifest zone. He asks someone to look at his dragonmark, which Rydia does, telling him it seems to have moved, and seems to have grown in size as well. Beck points out that’s very much not concerning and immediately gets called out for his sarcasm. 

They discuss what to do, talking about everything that’s been said. Lina points out that she’s somewhat surprised Galen doesn’t seem interested in the time travel aspect of this, as she always thought he was trying to fix what happened to Rydia. Galen is quick to correct her. 

Beck then says what everyone is thinking: Yonhanna needs to be stopped, and whatever she’s doing can’t happen. Considering they all still feel like they’re being watched, they don’t discuss much more, and don’t get the chance to either, as soon two warforged are at the door.

They are introduced as Hilt and Scimitar, one shorter and the second with a large splotch of paint across his face. Bonzo speaks to them and they share that they have been to the camp that Yonhanna mentioned before. Hilt says that the Lord of the Blades is angry with the world of flesh, largely because he thought he would have the Mournland to himself, and now people are here regardless. He considered the Mournland a paradise, which then got ruined.

He goes on to say that the Lord of the Blades is a charismatic man, who speaks sense, yet sometimes gets very violent. The main city of the warforged here is near lake Cyre and they loosely call it the Becoming City. This is where the Becoming God is. The Lord himself is currently in the camp near Making.

The two claim they have defected on their own volition, having been scared off by the Lord’s violence, but Beck is quick to deduce that they seem to be controlled by something or someone. He quietly points this out to Bonzo.

Bonzo then asks them if the Lord could be reasoned with, and if they could perhaps contact him, suggesting that bringing a gift might help. Neither of the two seem to know what kind of gift would be appropriate, though Bonzo deduces that is also because neither of them wants to suggest that bringing back defectors might be a decent gift. 

They seem unwilling to show the group to the camp out of fear of getting hurt, though Beck convinces them to at least show them part of the way there. They do say they will need Yonhanna’s permission to leave first. 

The two warforged then excuse themselves, and Gilaali, one of the Inspired, leads the group to the mess hall on Yonhanna’s request. There, they wait, and take another moment to discuss what to do. They think they’re being watched still, though Beck suggests it might just be some sort of side effect from being too close to a manifest zone to Xoriat. Rydia does recall that Vvaraak once said he always feels like he’s being watched. 

The door soon opens, and Yonhanna enters. Bonzo and Beck ask her about the warforged showing them to the camp and Yonhanna agrees, though asks for a favor in turn. Two of her Inspired are being held captive in the camp and she wants them back and, if that can’t be done, she wants to deliver a message to them. There’s a brief discussion on how to deliver said message, as Yonhanna insists on writing it down in illusionary script, and they are eventually given a vial of invisibility. 

She also shares that the prisoners are kept on the perimeter of the camp, with a guard tower nearby. With the group agreeing to try and get her people out, or at least deliver her message, Yonhanna agrees to send the warforged out with them the following day. 

Beck then voices an interest in the crystal, asking Yonhanna if they can be shown to it. She simply says that they can have it in four days and moves on from the subject. The group is then escorted back out of this area and asked to put on blindfolds again. 

Rydia keeps an eye out again as they head back, taking a slightly different route this time. They move through a museum like area and are eventually left outside the vault through which they came in that morning. 

Everyone agrees they should head back and discuss what to do next, so Lina starts casting her teleportation spell and before long, the group is back in Sharn. 

As soon as they’re back in the offices of the Order, they no longer feel like they’re being watched. They take their chance to discuss everything that happened, Rydia pointing out she’s somewhat surprised they left as she thinks they should take the crystal. The others agree, but say that they should have something more of a plan before they do that.

Novac questions why Yonhanna stayed in Making all that time, suggesting that perhaps it’s not just the warforged that are under someone’s control. They talk about how the sabotage of what happened, Beck pointing out that they know Fianin was there. Rydia thinks Vvaraak can shed some light on things as well, so they decide that, with the help of Rydia’s Dream spell, they’ll visit both Fianin and Vvaraak in their dreams that night to talk to them. 

Galen takes the time to check in on his sister, Esme. She seems okay, if not somewhat upset and after Galen spends most of the night at her place, she thanks him for coming by and checking up on her. 

When Galen gets back, Rydia is ready to cast her spell, first casting it on Petr so he can visit Fianin in her dream. She briefly explains how it works, suggesting Petr create somewhere simple the two of them can talk, and then Rydia casts the spell. 

Petr shapes the dream to look like the captain’s quarters aboard the Heritage, with a table for two and a large bottle of whiskey. Fianin seems confused at first, but doesn’t really question what’s happening, instead simply pointing out it’s been a while. 

Before diving into the questions he wants to ask, Petr asks her how she’s been. She says it’s been quiet and that’s been good for her. She’s been helping out in the butcher’s shop and keeping busy. Fianin asks Petr how things have been on his end, to which Petr tells her things have been hectic, mentioning preventing another Mourning, teleporting in and out of Making, and so on. 

This leads him into his questions. He mentions Yonhanna and the Mourning, asking Fianin about whether or not she was there that day. Fianin tells him she wasn’t, that she was in Valenar back then, asking Petr why he thinks she was there. He says they found her name in a register of sorts. She continues denying she was there, Petr fairly certain that she’s telling the truth. 

Fianin says this does explain some things. She tells Petr that after she and Beck commandeered the Heritage, they went by some of the House Cannith places, but they were faced with anger everywhere they went, the people there reacting violently to her in particular. That’s when she and Beck decided to set out on their own instead of staying with House Cannith. 

Petr asks why someone would want to implicate her and when Fianin asks what exactly happened, he explains that dreamlily was used to sabotage what was going on. That sparks Fianin’s memory and she shares a theory: Harash is behind all this. Harash is the one who hired the crew of the Heritage to transport the warforged way back when, and Fianin recalls running into him in Sharn at some point. He was accompanied by some doppelgangers at the time.

Harash is part of the Daask and Fianin theorizes that perhaps the Daask used those doppelgangers to borrow her likeness, and the likeness of someone else, to get inside. She did know about Clawrift, and was high ranking enough to have access to places like that at the time. 

She doesn’t know what the Daask’s reasoning for sabotaging any of that would’ve been, to which Petr points out they still intend to talk to Vvaraak for answers as well. This prompts Fianin to reach for the whiskey and rather than continue talking about all this, Petr suggests they should spend their time just catching up instead. 

Though Fianin appreciates this, she also suggests that perhaps she could come visit, but what with House Cannith still looking for her, Petr isn’t sure if that’s a good idea. He does tell her they’ll come visit some time, or that they can meet up elsewhere somewhere in the future, as he’s sure they won’t stay in Sharn forever. 

With Petr safely underway in his dream, Rydia then casts Dream on herself, so she can speak to Vvaraak. She shapes the dream to look like where the two of them first ‘spoke’, hoping to put him at much ease as possible. Vvaraak is there, looking somewhat weaker than he did the last time she saw him.

Rydia greets him with a simple ‘hi’, which leads to Vvaraak being amused. He then compliments her powers, saying she’s getting smart. Rydia tells him that she can change the scenery if he wants, and though he initially tells her no, he then asks for something that resembles the Eldeen Reaches. Rydia obliges.

She then tells Vvaraak she has some questions. She explains how they spoke to Yonhanna and how Yonhanna wants to contact Xoriat. She also points out she has one of the Eyes, which instantly concerns Vvaraak, who is quick to say they must stop Yonhanna. 

He recalls a place in Making, with a lot of eyes, and feeling like he was being watched. He says “it was her. I know it!” when talking about the eyes. Rydia tells him she knows the place, as she was just there that day. 

Vvaraak seems really concerned by what Rydia just told him. “You can’t fail this,” he says, Rydia saying that she and her friends will do whatever they can. Vvaraak comments on her ‘friends’, Rydia then pointing out he tried to eat one of them, the one he seems vaguely related to. 

Rydia then also mentions the co-terminus, which seems to ring a bell for Vvaraak. He mentions Brightblade, which Rydia knows is a date - the 12th of Nymm. She then says that Yonhanna thinks she can rewind the maze, which makes Vvaraak laugh, though he then promises Rydia whatever power she needs to stop this. “You can’t fail me now, I mean it. This is dangerous. This is what I saw. Them coming.”

With some concern, Rydia changes the subject, asking if there’s anything she can do for Vvaraak. He says he has difficultly calming down his mind, to which Rydia approaches him, carefully putting her hand on his snout. Though Vvaraak seems fidget a little, this does soon seem to calm him down somewhat.
