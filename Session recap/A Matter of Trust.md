# A Matter of Trust

![[residence of jod.jpeg]]


After collecting their reward from the Council of Nine for investigating the Calantar family, the group take a moment to recover as the skies over [[Korranberg]] grow darker, the rain beginning to pour down. Through the rain, Bonzobur makes his way through the city streets, heading towards the residence of [[Jodd Uthar Jarell]], having told the others that he’s heading out for a walk. Finding the building without too much trouble, the three story manor is covered in vines, a small rainsoaked rose garden in front of the building. One room is warmly lit, but the rest of the home seems to stand cold and dark. After knocking on the door, it’s pulled open by a construct - some kind of warforged, tall and lanky and dressed in satin and a lace collar. Bonzobur explains he was invited, the construct saying he’ll show him through to see Jod.

Moving through the house, the construct eventually opens a set of double doors to reveal a large room lit only by a fire in the hearth, various pieces of furniture littered around the space. Sitting before the fire and watching the flames is Jod, who seems pleased that Bonzobur has accepted his request. The construct, Max, asks if Bonzo would like anything to drink before departing to get him some tea. Jod says he feels he was fortunate when Bonzobur walked in, as Argoth, a giant flying fortress, was Bonzobur’s project at some point. The Brelish King commissioned a second one of these some time ago, however that one lies rusting on the border with the Mournland - Kennrun. Bonzo wasn’t involved with the construction of the second one, leading him to conclude that people have begun to copy his designs.



Jod explains that King Kaius of Karrnath has requested Jod to retrofit Kennrun in order to send it into the Mournland. The machine has been derelict for some time, and Jod would like Bonzobur’s assistance on the project, interested in how Bonzobur managed to maintain the structural integrity of the roof and the bridge in his designs. Wheeling himself to the desk, Jod taps something to reveal a large hologram schematic of the machine.



Aware that Jod was abandoned by the Architects for working with Karrnath during the last war, Bonzobur confirms what it is Jod is asking for. He says he didn’t think Jod was part of the Architects anymore, but the request came from Kaius directly, Jod and Kaius working together directly on several projects, according to him. Whilst Bonzobur is slightly uneasy about the secrecy around the meeting, Jod points out Bonzobur is no longer with the Architects either, Bonzobur admitting he hasn’t been to a council meeting for some time. He asks to look at the plans, and Bonzo immediately notices some more organic parts to the designs, the shape of a few bones in the machine. Bonzobur asks Jod about it, Jod explaining that given they’re heading into the Mournland, bone doesn’t rust. Parts of the schematic are the same as the original design, and Jod begins to go over it as Max returns with Bonzobur’s tea.



Bonzobur says he’ll need some time to look at the plans, in order to think over the best approach. Jod admits he hoped the plans could remain at his home, but he’s having trouble with them. Bonzobur says he cannot stay, and Jod reluctantly agrees to allow Bonzobur to take the plans for a day. Bonzo agrees to this, Jod thanking him for his help and eventually offering a consultant’s rate of 750gp for a day’s work. Bonzobur agrees to this, and Jod wheels himself back to the fire, telling Bonzo to leave the empty teacup with Max.



Meanwhile back on the airship, Galen finds the Ring of Protection they found in the Calantar house before going in search of Rydia. After a while he finds a white haired Rydia in the kitchen, telling her that he thinks maybe she should have the ring. Rydia turns around to see Galen holding a ring and drops the cup she’s holding, staring at him for a long moment before eventually realising where the ring came from. Galen asks what she thought was happening, but she dismisses it before asking why Galen thinks she should have it, thanking him and taking the ring. Galen explains that she seems to be the least armoured out of the group, and he hoped the ring might help to keep her safe. “Ever the romantic,” Rydia tells him, before Galen admits he tries. Rydia gives a soft smile, Galen saying he’ll buy her more jewellery if this is the kind of reaction he gets. Quickly changing the subject, Rydia says she has a pie in the oven before Galen calls out to Lux, asking if she wants dinner and if she found a first aid kit yet.



After getting some rest and recovering from the day’s events, the group returns to the Korranberg Library, Lux and Bonzo leading the way through the colleges in search of a bound elemental. They’re eventually led to a section underneath the main college, the red stone halls much older than the building above. There’s a few statues of hobgoblins, meaning this is likely part of an old Dhaakani ruin. Reaching a desk, there’s an old white haired female gnome with large glasses. She introduces herself as Talia, before asking what it is they’re looking for. Lux explains they’re hoping to purchase an air elemental, as well as the rig to place it in the ship. Talia explains the elemental is available off the shelf, although none of them seem to be able to control the elemental as they lack the Mark of the Storm. However this can be taught, and she suggests a skilled artificier would be able to mount it to a vehicle in a way that doesn’t need that much control. Bonzobur offers to help with this work, but Talia warns them there’s no returns, and if they lose the elemental there are no replacements. Talia offers for someone to supervise the work to ensure it’s done properly, meaning the total bill comes to 3300gp for the elemental and installation. Agreeing to the purchase, Talia says someone will be by [[The Heritage]] in a couple of hours with the elemental to assist in the installation.



After agreeing to this, the group return to the airship, Bonzobur spending some time with Jod’s plans, looking into the details of how the machine is intended to work. He notices they’ve added double plating to prevent some of the effects of the Mournland, but it’s adding a lot of weight to the machine - likely why some components were switched for bone. Some of the bones seem to have metal infused, along with a small lightning elemental - this is similar to the previous project Jod worked on for King Kaius, which featured metal dipped skeletons, held together by minor lightning elementals which allowed them to reform after an impact. Bonzo noticed a few of the joints seem to have a weak spot, which Bonzobur knows will be causing an issue. It seems they cut corners on the newer version, which was likely the reason it was destroyed so quickly. Bonzobur adjusts the plans to repair these issues, whilst also introducing a tiny flaw that would likely make the machine fail once more, hoping to get it past Jod’s notice.



Having completed the adjustments, Bonzobur returns to Jod’s home, delivering the completed plans. Max goes to fetch more tea as Jod clears his desk, Bonzobur taking some time to highlight the changes he made to the plans, carefully avoiding the flaw he introduced. Jod takes notes as they go over everything, before pointing out the flaw and asking Bonzobur what it is. Bonzobur feigns surprise as he points it out, claiming it was a mistake, however Jod doesn’t buy this excuse, stating Bonzo put it there deliberately. Bonzo attempts to continue the deception, before Jod tells him to stop lying, or he’ll have Max flatten him over his desk. He asks if Bonzobur was planning on sabotaging it, Bonzobur eventually admitting he’ll come clean. “All my life, I’ve been designing these tools of destruction for the war, and a lot of misery has come from it. I’m fed up with it, and I have to admit I was trying to sabotage it, yes.” Bonzobur says he can forget the payment and will repair the flaw he introduced, as well as make some additional improvements to make up for the hassle. Jod agrees he can make the changes, but he has to make them there. Max offers to get more tea, Jod saying Bonzobur will be staying for a while.



Heading out on her own, Rydia finds a mask shop, commissioning something similar to what they found in the Calantar manor. They tell her it would be around 2gp for the work, and Rydia carefully explains she has a condition she’d like them to cover. Trying to show the shop attendant, Rydia reduces the first woman to tears before the owner of the shop comes out from the back room, consoling his apprentice before taking Rydia’s measurements with trembling hands. He promises to start work on it right away, Rydia apologising profusely every time a tentacle gets too close. She leaves them 10gp, apologises again before she leaves, the shop owner telling her the mask will be ready in two days.



Lux goes in search of some shiftweave, finding a tailor who works with the unassuming looking fabric. She explains it would be 200gp for an outfit made of shiftweave, which would be able to contain five outfits of Lux’s choosing, allowing her to move between them at will. Explaining her designs, the tailor sets to work on creating Lux’s new outfit.



With the elemental safely in place within the bowels of the ship, Galen, Lux and Rydia head out in search of Viqora’s Secret Stash. They eventually find a small building with a single gnome sized green door, the name printed above it in Common and Gnomish. Heading inside, the room is completely empty, with a single vase on the ground. There’s a little bit of light hitting the vase, and a note that says “Be Right Back” beside it. Rydia admits she might have forgotten something, heading outside and retrieving a flower from one of the gardens in the street. She returns to the shop, before putting the flower in the vase. As she does so, the walls around them fall down to reveal a much larger room - a large opulent mansion that seems to go on forever. Most of the room disappears into darkness, with a few red doors around them with numbers on them. There’s some dancing lights above them, and the room seems to fill with smoke. From within the smoke emerges an invisible person, with a cord around its neck holding a sign. Text begins to scroll across the sign, saying “Hello, my name is Devin”. After a little bit of confusion, Galen asks if they have some healing potions, Devin’s sign telling them to follow as he heads towards one of the doors. Rydia comments she’s tempted to ask for the manager just to see what happens, but they eventually follow, finding the new room filled with shelves upon shelves of objects. Devin drifts upwards, collecting three bottles before returning to the group with 1 Greater and 2 Regular Healing Potions.



Agreeing to purchase all three, they ask if there’s anything else interesting they should be purchasing, Devin eventually producing a brass doorknob. Putting it on a section of wall, he opens an empty cupboard, closing it again before showing them the doorknob and the price tag attached. Concluding the doorknob creates a portable storage space for them, they agree it might be good to have somewhere to stash things, Lux pointing out they could stop worrying about the Dream Lily. Lux asks if there’s a discount for buying all of the items, Devin handing over a single white card, agreeing they can have a healing potion for free if they agree to be a returning customer. They have franchises in 12 locations across Khorvaire, the card revealing ink which lists the various places, including Sharn, Fairhaven and [[Passage]] - [[Metrol]] and Making are also on the card, but are crossed out. Paying the 600gp for the entire purchase, the group then make their way outside the shop and back into the streets of Korranberg.



Galen asks to drop by the House Sivis mail office, and Lux says she wouldn’t mind stopping off at the library. Making a loop of it, Galen collects a couple of letters from his mailbox before the group make their way back towards the Korranberg Library. As they head there, Jod releases Bonzobur, satisfied that the work is completed to a good standard. Galen notices Bonzo heading back towards Skyport, as a cold breeze swirls around Lux, Galen and Rydia. Lux reaches out to catch it, reading the note carried by the breeze. “Very disappointing that you would resolve this with the authorities so soon. I’m assuming you’re fine with me leading them towards your stash of Dream Lily then. Let’s meet again at the Drunk Library and discuss this - Ivello.”



As they’re reading the note, Galen notices the glint of a telescope on one of the rooftops nearby, as if someone’s watching them. Galen informs the rest that they’re being watched, subtly pointing it out to the others. Telling the others to continue heading to the Library, Galen slips away to catch Bonzo. He tells them they’re heading to the Library, Bonzo happily joining them. Galen asks if the Trust are in the habit of watching people with telescopes, which Bonzobur says seems a bit odd - telescopes are expensive and not used by the general Trust members. Moving to catch the others, the group reconvene at the Library, making it there without much trouble.



Heading to the desk, Lux asks about researching Vvaraak and the Aerenal, curious to look into what Randala was talking about. Cutting in, Galen offers to help her out, finding a table in one of the study halls before beginning to pull the relevant books from the stacks, as well as putting his own journal on the table. Various windows show the city of Korranberg as well as the rest of the library around them. Galen asks what it is Lux was looking for, eventually admitting that what Randala was talking about seemed interesting and important, so she wanted to look into it. She doesn’t really know exactly what they’re looking for, but asks why Galen’s asking. Galen pulls over his journal, opening it and showing it to Lux. The book is mostly filled with notes on Vvaraak, with more than one person’s handwriting present in the pages. Lux asks if it’s his, which Galen confirms, although he admits he’s had help over a number of years. Lux asks if it’s to do with the book he and Rydia searched for, Galen admitting that the name of the book was the Tome of Vvaraak. He explains Vvaraak was an ancient green dragon, connected to the druids, the draconic prophecy and Xoriat - and according to the book from Randala’s place, Vvaraak is also Erandis’ mother. He explains what he knows of Aerenal, admitting he doesn’t know how Randala ties into all this. Lux says they can’t ask her, and Galen says they could, although going back is a bad idea. Lux suggests looking for a family connection, asking if there’s something there that could help. “What are you looking for help with? What do you want to get out of this?” Galen asks, Lux moving to point at Rydia before realising she’s nowhere in sight.



Galen assumes that’s who Lux was looking for, Lux pointing out all of this ties into her. Galen concedes that’s true, before saying the best way to help Rydia is to go to Q’barra. “Vvaraak has been a project of mine, and some other people, for years. I’m not saying I know everything, but I’ve probably read every book in this library on the subject.” Galen admits he doesn’t know how Rydia ended up in her current state, or where the book went. Lux says it seems pretty big and scary, so knowing as much as possible is a good starting point. Galen asks her what the end is, as she came to the library for something. Lux explains she just wants to know a bit about what she’s walking into, Galen responding that Vvaraak is an old dragon, connected to the Undying Court, Erandis and Karrnath, meaning it’s all heading places he doesn’t really like. However, most of this can be dealt with later, Ivello’s note being slightly more urgent.



Lux admits she’s uncomfortable with Rydia being out there on her own given the circumstance, Galen saying she can look after herself. Lux expresses concern as these are real pirates, but Galen points out Rydia eats people, Lux still saying splitting up probably isn’t a great idea. Galen tells her he didn’t think Rydia would want to be here for this conversation anyway, given what she was researching. Lux says there’s no point to her research anyway, given Galen’s apparently done it all already. Galen apologises, explaining he’s been working on this for a while, and nothing good came of it. Lux suggests Q’barra might hold some answers, or at least more questions, and Galen proceeds to show Lux the research he did on Q’barra and the Draconic Prophecy earlier in the week.



Meanwhile, Bonzobur returns with a stack of books on Karrnath and King Kaius, along with what he can find about Kennrun, although it’s not well documented. Most of the documentation he can find is on Kaius, along with a popular rumour that Kaius the Third is actually Kaius the First, returned as a vampire. A militaristic society, Karrnath uses necromancy to bolster their ranks with undead soldiers, and Bonzobur finds a number of documents comparing this to the use of Warforged as soldiers. Bonzo looks for a connection to Kennrun, finding some speculation about the Mourning, trying to work out how it encapsulated Cyre so perfectly. There’s also been some discussion about what would have happened without the Mourning - there’s general agreement that it stopped the war, and if someone could explain it and ways to prevent it, the war would likely restart.



Noticing what Bonzobur is researching, Galen asks if he’s looking into Karrnath. Bonzobur claims it’s a general interest after his experiences in the war, as he’s into history. Galen offers to help as he spent a bit of time in Karrnath, Bonzobur saying he might ask for help later. Bonzo pays the fee of 2sp to borrow some of the books from the library.



Having departed the library as they arrived, not really interested in research, Rydia makes her way towards the post office. The clerk asks how he can help her, and from behind her mask, she asks if there’s any messages for Rydia Bennet. The clerk returns with two envelopes, the first letter about three months ago, the second from two months ago. After collecting her mail, Rydia begins walking back towards the Library.



As they have further discussions inside the Library, Lux begins to feel nauseous, Bonzobur and Galen noticing this. Galen suggests returning to the ship, explaining the note they received from Ivello to Bonzo. Immediately beginning to clear up, the group make their way downstairs and outside into the courtyard. They begin to make their way towards the Skyport, Galen assuring them Rydia would find them eventually. As they move outside, Galen spots the glint of a telescope again, on the roof of a different college, about 200ft away. Lux’s stomach continues to twist as they move, Galen noticing a hand near the spyglass, seemingly using magic. Lux stumbles, grasping her stomach as something bursts from her torso, a watery slimy creature, intermingled with Lux’s blood as it rises from her body.



Lux reaches for her rapier, trying to beat back the creature emerging from her, although it quickly wraps around her, water flooding into her mouth as it does so. Meanwhile, Galen and Bonzo are hit by something invisible charging at them. Galen tries to cut the watery creature away from Lux’s throat, which seems to damage both Lux and the Tracker holding her. Having collected his mechanical alpaca, Betsy, from outside the library, Bonzo and Betsy begin to assault the invisible creature, Bonzo swinging at it with a wrench, the strike making it glow and revealing the form of an elemental creature - a Stalker. Lux manages to escape the Tracker, which instead latches onto Galen as the Stalker attacks Bonzobur. Meanwhile from the roof of one of the college buildings, Ivello hurls a bolt of Lightning at Rydia, who was running towards the fight having seen them in trouble on her return from the post office. The passers by in the street start to arm themselves, seemingly looking to get involved, although unsure of who to blame.



Escaping from the Tracker, Galen keeps himself between a severely wounded Lux and the creature, as Bonzo continues the assault on the Stalker. Lux uses Dissonant Whispers on the Tracker, Galen and Bonzo attacking at it as it flees, the creature falling into a harmless pool of water under the assault. Lux calls to the gnomes for help, telling them they’re under attack. Seeming convinced, the gnomes start to move to their aid, focusing on the Stalker as well as Ivello on the roof.



Rydia removes her mask, the left side of her face mostly a mess of eyes and teeth as Galen notices the one normal eye on her face is red from tears. She focuses in on Ivello, moving towards him before casting Hunger of Hadar on the roof, a dark sphere of Eldritch horrors appearing on the rooftop. Ivello starts to flee, getting out of the darkness and casting a Sleet Storm across the square, the area covered in ice and freezing rain. The gnomes run to the group’s aid, although one sends his mechanical dog after Rydia, unconvinced thanks to the maw on her neck.



Galen takes a shot at the Stalker before asking Lux if she’s okay, who tells him she’s still alive. “No more complaining about what comes out of my stomach,” Galen tells her, before running into the Sleet Storm towards Rydia. Bonzo slips on the ice, getting to his feet to and finishing off the Stalker as Lux eventually manages to dispel the Sleet Storm, before calling to the gnomes, telling them Rydia is friendly, and whilst they seem unconvinced, one does call back the dog from Rydia. Meanwhile, Rydia releases the Hunger of Hadar and casts Mind Spike on Ivello before starting to climb the building after him. Ivello continues to flee, two of the gargoyles on the rooftop coming to life in order to try and prevent their progress.



Seeing the gargoyles, Galen manages to take one of them out in one single massive blow, Bonzobur and Lux dealing with the other one to clear the way for Rydia to continue in pursuit. Galen continues running after Rydia along with the rest of the party, but forced to take the long way around, Rydia gets to Ivello first, using an Eldritch Blast to knock him from where he’s trying to climb away, the impact knocking him back to the rooftop, weak and barely conscious. Rydia approaches him, Ivello opening an eye and throwing up his hands, however Rydia starts to tear into him, finishing him off.



Closer to Ivello, they can see there’s a tattoo on his body written in Dwarvish.
