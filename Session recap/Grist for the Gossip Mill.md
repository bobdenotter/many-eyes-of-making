# Grist for the Gossip Mill
Saedra walks up to Galen, cutting in and asking him for a dance, charming him in the process. Rydia is right beside Galen still and warns the others of this happening as back by the bar, Petr sees things happen as well and forces himself to sober up. He casts lesser restoration, then turns to Bonzo and asks him to slap him in the face, which Bonzo does.

There’s a thin smile on Saedra’s face as she guides Galen to the dance floor, asking him where ‘she’ is. Rydia uses telekinesis to trip Saedra, though the latter is unable to tell that it was Rydia doing so. Galen offers her a hand and the two of them resume their dance as well as their conversation.

He tells her that he has no idea where Erandis is, but he does admit that he helped free her. He shows her his hand as well. “So what is her plan?” Saedra then asks, not knowing why Erandis moved away from the ones that could protect her. Galen says he thinks Erandis was simply sick of being trapped in the same place for so long.

Saedra is convinced they talked about more, but Galen sums it up as he and Erandis simply having had a conversation and her wanting him to help her out. “What can I say, I’m a sucker for a damsel in distress.” Saedra suggests that her consort, Mister Radovich, try something on Galen; if he has nothing to hide, why would he mind?

Galen tells her he’s apprehensive considering what happened the last time he was around her council. Saedra suggests that the council has done nothing but help Galen lately, though Galen points out that what they did to him before all that was less pleasant. She starts casting a spell and Rydia, who notices this, pointedly trips her again, interrupting said spell.

Saedra looks around again, now seemingly convinced that Sorik Sensos is the one thwarting her attempts here, not realising it was Rydia tripping her. Rydia alerts the others again to what Saedra seems to be doing. Beck has now made his way over towards Rydia, asking her for a dance, the two of them subtly dancing closer to where Galen and Saedra are still on the dance floor as well.

Petr and Bonzo lean back at the bar, but make sure to keep a close eye on the situation. Saedra then moves away from Galen and starts approaching Sorik Sensos, addressing some of the nobles surrounding her. “I don’t know how, but this man keeps interrupting my conversation and dance; I suggest you remove him from the premises.”

Nine of the twelve nobles around her fall subject to her Suggestion spell, all of them crowding around the Sensos family. Beck takes advantage of the distraction to inspire Galen before Saedra returns, glad that the situation seems to have been dealt with. She says she’ll take him over to the bar for a drink, and that Radovich will make sure they get the truth out of him.

Galen simply asks her what she wants; she wants to know what Erandis’ plan is and she wants to catch her before something horrible happens. “The girl doesn’t know her powers, she has no idea what the Mark of Death is capable of. Which is why she’s in need of our guidance.” Galen points out they should’ve taught her how to use it, rather than lock her away. Saedra points out she was locked away in a castle, with servants; hardly a terrible situation. “It’s not our fault she murdered them all.”

Rydia takes the chance to reach out to Thiria, pointing out she had an opinion about spellcasting on the dance floor earlier. The Sensos family is still surrounded, but Sorik Sensos yells out a powerful command, which gets most of the nobles surrounding them to stand down.

Most people at the party now seem to be aware that something’s going on and everyone’s somewhat tense. Galen points out to Saedra there’s no reason to make this party uncivil in some way as Thiria responds to Rydia’s message. “Who is this person?” she asks, Rydia telling her she doesn’t know, but this person’s been casting a lot of spells and they’re not just for show.

Thiria walks right past Rydia and up to Saedra and Galen. “You need to get out of here and never show your face in Sharn again,” she says, casting a spell on Saedra, but she manages to shake off its effects. Saedra seems angry at all of this, looking for a fight, but it doesn’t take too long before it becomes clear to even her that the entire room has turned against her.

Though her consort, Radovich, joins the fray for a moment and tries to attack Galen, he’s quickly grappled to the ground and Beck then manages to grapple Saedra herself as well. With the two of them somewhat under control and the Sensos family having moved in as well, Saedra soon realises that she’s outnumbered, though Beck senses she’s still determined to come back to this matter in some way.

That being said, Beck and Galen release her and Radovich and they start making their way out of the party, Galen sending Saedra of with a ‘give my regards to Lady Vidante’. With them taking their leave, Sorik Sensos approaching Beck and Rydia. “What happened before is water under the bridge, right? You did remarkably well with such a powerful adversary,” he says, Beck and Rydia saying they’d appreciate if it could indeed be water under the bridge.

“I personally would like to apologise to your daughter and thank her for her assistance,” Rydia adds, Beck offering to heal Thiria some as well, as she was hit with a Blight spell during everything that happened before. Thiria accepts this, letting Beck heal her.

Rydia checks in with Galen, joking about what kind of women he’s into. Galen, who was quickly explaining to Esme and Lina what just happened, excuses himself from them and joins Rydia to go over to speak to Sorik and his family. Thiria thanks Rydia for defending her, Rydia in turn thanking her for stepping in.

Apologies are exchanged over how things got heated on the dance floor, before Rydia turns the conversation to the security at this place. Sorik says that he and his family try to keep Sharn safe; the Tain family does have regular security, but those were sent home for the night. Nothing ever happens during these galas. Sorik then says that, whilst he’s grateful for their help, he does have some questions, turning to Galen.

Galen explains that this woman is from an order in Karrnath he had a falling out with, apologising that his personal conflicts put people in danger. “I did not expect her to pursue me here in this city, let alone at this party.” Sensos agrees it seems foolish of her to have stepped into this ballroom and try what she did, Galen assuring him that he’s sure whatever happens next with be his problem and not theirs.

Sensos points out that if it happens in Sharn, it’ll be his problem as well, sharing that he’s always interested in people who have a personal issue with Karrnath. His faith tells him to pursue the undead rigorously, which makes Karrnath a tricky subject.

“Would you mind if we held a little meeting for you and your friends?” Sorik then suggests, saying he overheard them speaking of needing funding for something. “I’m part of the Golden Concord and I have some friends who are probably willing to pay for a good case. Especially after they hear this story of … betrayal on the dance floor. Makes for a good tale, I think.” Galen tells him that would be greatly appreciated, to which he says he will set something up. They exchange details, before Sensos excuses himself.

The crew regroups at the bar where Rydia gets everyone drinks. Petr says he’ll go for some water; he hit the bottle pretty hard earlier and is no longer in the mood for more drinks. He explains how Bonzo helped him sober up, Galen saying he’s glad they had fun. Petr adds he wasn’t having a lot of luck with getting funds, Beck adding in that he did manage to get them at least one sponsor.

As the evening progresses, people are talking about what happened and the crew are approached about it as well. Vilroy seems pleased still, despite Beck and the others having spoken to Sensos after it. “I’m sure you understand that making an enemy out of the Sensos family wasn’t part of our agenda,” Beck tells him.

Lina and Esme approach the crew, Lina telling them when they’re expecting to leave and, with what happened that evening and what people have been saying, she expects they’ll receive more than enough donations to fund the mission. “I have plenty of appointments, don’t worry about funding anymore, we’ll get there. I think we’ve got this in the bag.” Esme and Lina then eventually take their leave, the crew staying behind a moment longer.

Some other guests are starting to leave as well, but as Beck looks for Merrix d’Cannith, he does still find him. He seems somewhat drunk as Beck approaches him, asking if it’s okay if he asks some questions about House Cannith. Asking about the expeditions into the Mournland, Merrix admits it’s not really his cup of tea, but he does know they’ve been sending in warforged, though a lot of them haven’t returned.

He mentions rumors about a charismatic warforged leader out there who’s trying to gather up as many warforged as he can, building some sort of cult. “Do you know if we’re sending in the warforged on retrieval missions, or are we trying to find out what happened?” Merrix says most of it’s retrieval. “We kind of know what happened,” he adds, before instantly saying he shouldn’t have said that and mentioning they’re very vague on the details.

Beck asks about the details, but Merrix won’t share too much more. When asked if these details are something they’re trying to hide, Merrix drags Beck to a quiet corner of the room. “You didn’t hear this from me, but yes. There’s things that House Cannith has to make sure stay hidden, because otherwise the war might just y’know, start back up again. And we don’t want that.” He adds that producing the warforged brought in a lot of money and there’s voices in the house that do want to share what happened, but Merrix doesn’t think it’s smart and a lot of people agree with him, so their policy at the moment is to keep it quiet. “Just know that it’s for the safety of Khorvaire.”

Beck asks him if he knows if Jonah in particular agrees with keeping things hidden. Merrix says Jonah’s a little shit, but he’s done a good job with tying up loose ends. It’s Jonah’s main job now, keeping this a secret. With the conversation done, Beck excuses himself and joins the rest of the crew.

Meanwhile, Rydia finds Petr, addressing something that the psychiatrist pointed out earlier that day. Petr assures her that nothing’s going on and that he just views Rydia as a friend, leaving out the fact that the reason he’s keeping an eye on her is because the Gatekeepers have asked him to do so. Rydia says she’s glad, saying she makes a good hangover cure which she promises to make for him in the future if he’s ever in need of it.

At the bar, Galen and Bonzo talk shop about guns, Galen lamenting the fact that his gun jams so much. Bonzo says his doesn’t jam up, because it doesn’t use ammunition, though he can’t show Galen right now as they left their weapons behind. They conclude that the fact that Galen hasn’t cleaned his gun since he got it might be the reason why it keeps jamming. Bonzo promises to take a look at the gun once they’re back at the ship.

As the evening draws to a close, the crew arranges for a skycoach to take them back to Lyrander tower. Before they retreat to their bunks for the night, they agree to take watches, as none of them feel particularly safe considering Galen got taken from this exact place that morning. Rydia asks what Saedra’s full name is and Galen gives it to her. Rydia casts Psychic Lance, which should hit Saedra if she’s within a certain area of the ship. They don’t hear anything.

Rydia stays up all night as she doesn’t need to sleep, Petr, Bonzo and Beck joining her for their respective watches. Bonzo takes the time to look at Galen’s gun as well, realising that he could probably give it some upgrades if he had a day to work on it. Beck and Rydia, who took last watch, prepare breakfast together, Rydia making sure that Galen wakes up to a cup of coffee and a note with a heart and a tentacle on it.

The crew then takes the next couple of days before they go on the mission to get some affairs in order.

Within one or two days, Bonzo receives an invite from his father, asking him to meet him for lunch. A couple of hours later, Bonzo returns with a glowing amulet on his neck and a tale to tell about what just happened. He seeks out Beck first, who shared earlier what Merrix said about the warforged cult.

He shares that he’s heard of a group of warforged gathering within the Mournland under the guidance of the Lord of Blades. There’s people related to that active in Sharn as well and Bonzo managed to prevent a temple of Onathar of falling to this calt. They were making a new massive warforged titan out of that temple, where there was an active creation forge. Creation forges are actively banned at the moment.

It looked like this Lord of Blades was already getting a number of followers and Bonzo suggests they look into that as well when they’re in the Mournland. “He’s scheming from within the Mournland and no one can see what he’s doing.” The goal of this warforged is twofold - he wants to create a god called the Becoming God. He also wants to wage war on flesh. Beck agrees that interfering in some way might be a good idea and they decide to at least keep a look out.

Beck recalls that the Lord of Blades was a very charismatic and powerful warforged titan who split of from the Cyrian armed forces during the Last War. He first started back in the Valenar deserts, gathering other warforged and telling them to stop working for men. It started as a small force of deserters and when the Mourning happened, they retreated to the Mournland, especially after they discovered they could go there and others couldn’t.

Since then, no one has heard from them in a long time. They do seem to have been silently reaching out from the Mournlands since then, trying to gather new recruits in cities with large warforged populations.

Bonzo wonders if it’s a good idea to look into what their activity here in Sharn is, Beck suggesting they might be recruiting, but they could certainly look into more details. They agree to try and find some more information before they leave on their mission.

Beck also takes the time to send some letters in the following days. He sends a letter to Fianin (including ten platinum) as well as one to his parents. Both letters generally check in on them, but in the letter to his parents, Beck also asks them if they’ve heard about anyone looking for crystals or Eyes, or if they do come across something like this, they let him know.

He also takes some time to look into what the ‘after life’ is supposed to look like, visiting some temples to try and get some more information. In general, it seems most people agree that everybody who dies ends up in Dolor, which is a timeless place, oblivion. Some religions do believe that their God will bring them to some ‘better’ place, but there is no known plane of gods.

Beck and Galen also take some time to head to the library to research some more things.

Meanwhile, Petr checks by the post office, where there’s a reply from the Gatekeepers. They thank him for his update, seeming glad there’s no big threat regarding Rydia. They ask him if he can ask Rydia for the location of the Tome of Vvaraak. Petr writes them back, telling them he hasn’t figured out where the book is yet. He also warns them he might not write for a little while, as they’re going into the Mournland.

He and Bonzo then seek out a magic shop. Between Bonzo and Lina’s connections, they find out about two magic shops that might be worth visiting. One is called Munt’s Curiosities, a supplier Lina frequently works with. Another shop they hear about is Postreus’ Plunder, which Bonzo knows is run by a peculiar creature that looks like a bipedal vulture. Unable to learn magic herself, she’s learned to plunder and pilfer magic and stock it up and is up for exchanging magic items or spell scrolls.

They decide to head to Munt’s Curiosities first. It’s a tiny building wedged inbetween two larger structures. There are no windows, just an oddly wide door and a small sign hanging above it. Inside, there’s a high ceiling, walls decorated with shelves and shelves of items of all sorts. Stuck inbetween the back wall and the desk, is a hippo man, who looks to be very uncomfortable.

He greets the two of them, asking how he can help them. “Commodore Warrington Munt,” the man introduces himself, after which Petr tells him what he’s looking for. After some discussion and bargaining, they eventually make a deal with Munt. Petr gets a Cloak of Elvenkind and Bonzo buys an ointment that helps with diseases and other ailments. Petr also asks the commodore to put in an order for a Cloak of Protection.

This would’ve cost the two of them 660 gold, however after they mention Lina’s name, Munt offers to put it on her account and neither Petr nor Bonzo tell him not to.

Meanwhile, Galen looks into making an appointment with the Alistair family. He and Rydia make their way to Sky’s Edge Park, where they know the family live. They make their way towards the biggest tower, the road sloping up to a townhouse of sorts. There are two round staircases that lead up to a central entrance and they make their way up, knocking on the door.

It takes a short while, but then the door is answered by a younger man. Short hair with a long rat tail, wearing simple clothing and no shoes. Galen asks if it’s possible to speak to the head of the house, which prompts the young man to ask what it’s about. He mentions the Emerald Claw, clarifying they’re not with it, gesturing at Rydia as well.

“Ah, of course, I see, you’ve come to see about uncle Kaani. Is that who you’re looking for?” Galen says they simply heard a rumor, but they have no name. “If that’s who you think we’re looking for, then sure.” The man says he’ll see if he can set something up for them, warning them he’s not sure Kaani is keen on receiving visitors.

A short while later he returns, accompanied by a woman. She’s wearing a nice green dress, her grey hair up in a bun. There’s a big piece of jewellery as well, with a large green emerald in the center. She addresses Galen and Rydia, introducing herself as Irati Alistair. Both Galen and Rydia introduce themselves in turn. “He would be delighted to welcome you,” she then says, before inviting them inside.

They’re led inside through a nice looking hallway with tiled patterns on the floor. There’s plants everywhere, critters running amongst them as well and birds nested in plants hanging from the ceiling. Irati excuses herself, saying she’ll go get Kaani after offering Galen and Rydia to take a seat in the salon.

Inside the salon, there’s a number of plants, as well as two small monkeys that stare Galen and Rydia down as they take a seat. A bit later, she returns, wheeling a wheelchair into the room with in it a strangely half molten looking man in it. He still has one eye and half a mouth and he’s sitting almost perfectly still in the chair.
“Well, that doesn’t bode well,” Rydia says, before she hears a voice in her mind, asking her if she’s like him. She replies in her mind as well, saying she thinks she is. When asked how she got this way, she explains about the book, adding that she thinks she ate the Tome of Vvaraak.

Irati shares a look with Galen, both of them used to the mental talks these days. Galen strikes up a conversation with her as Rydia and Kaani continue conversating in their minds.

Kaani tells Rydia that he found a seed that he’s been trying to plant in the park for a couple of years. “It never sprouts”. He adds that he hasn’t cracked the problems with it yet, but he hopes to. Rydia then asks him if he’s spoken to Vvaraak at any point. He says he did speak to Vvaraak when he was first given the seed, but he was hoping to get more face time with him. “But then I accepted his gifts, I started planting this and my condition got worse.”

He asks her in turn, Rydia admitting that she does speak to Vvaraak sometimes. Kaani asks her if she can in turn ask Vvaraak about the purpose of the seed; she says she can try. She adds that both she and Vvaraak aren’t really clear on things, before she asks Kaani about whether or not Vvaraak mentioned the ‘Coming’ to him.

For a moment, he’s quiet, seemingly thinking back on whether or not it was mentioned. “Yes, he mentioned a Coming, a world reborn, a world.. unshackled from madness,” Kaani then says, Rydia saying that sounds familiar to her too. She then asks about the seed, curious what it looks like. Kaani telepathically shows her an image of it; it’s about the size of an avocado, except golden.

Rydia asks for a moment to speak with Galen, showing Galen an image of the seed as well, asking him if he recognises it. He doesn’t, wondering about why Vvaraak would want Kaani to grow a tree. Galen then turns to Irati, asking her how long Kaani has been in the state he’s in right now. “He’s sadly been in this state for about twelve years now,” she says, adding it all started when he went off on a quest and found the seed.

He hoped it would help the park, but he started to deteriorate rather fast after that. Galen asks if it wasn’t anything to do with the family, mentioning that he heard this family helped Vvaraak a few centuries ago. Irati says that most of the Alistair are of druidic traditions and admits that they helped him hide.

When Galen asks what they helped him hide from, Irati doesn’t answer, but Kaani does. “The Eyes of Chronepsis; who wanted to stop him,” he says in Galen’s head, stop him from fulfilling the prophecy. They’re also still his disciples, which means it didn’t end with them helping him back then. Galen then asks where they hid him, which prompts Kaani to look over at him. He says Vvaraak is somewhere no one will find him.

This prompts Rydia to describe the cave she saw, as well as the skin. Kaani turns to look at Rydia then. He asks about the skin, Rydia then describing how Vvaraak looked when she spoke to him. “There was a cave, there was loose skin everywhere, he was scaleless and full of marks.” She adds that he also seemed somewhat insane, despite all of Vvaraak’s accusations that her brain was soup. Kaani says that Vvaraak told him the same thing. He seems to be getting more tired.

Rydia reaches out to Kaani, grabbing his hand, telling him that maybe Vvaraak wasn’t talking to them, or about them. Kaani seems to appreciate the sentiment of that at least, perking up a little. There’s a long pause then, before he addresses Rydia again. “We hid him in the Twilight Forest.”

She thanks him for sharing that, before speaking out loud as well as mentally, asking if it’s okay if they visit more often. Irati says that Kaani sleeps a lot, but they are always welcome to visit. Rydia then says she thinks they have the information they wanted, at which Galen says he was hoping someone could help them with Rydia learning how to control some of what happened to her. “But I don’t think those answers are here.”

Irati and Kaani say they’re not sure how to help with that, Galen saying they’ve mostly been having some trouble with guards and running into people who react badly to the maw. With the conversation coming to a close, Irati wheels her uncle back out the room, she Kaani wishing Galen and Rydia well before the door is opened for them.

About seven days after the ball, Beck receives a Sending spell from House Sivis on behalf of Jonah. “Lord Jonah d’Cannith wishes to speak with you in the aforementioned bar, tomorrow evening.” Beck confirms that he’ll be there.

In the days leading up to both Jonah’s arrival as well as the mission, Rydia takes the time to try and train with her powers. She also buys two mannequins, using them to display her and Galen’s outfits from the ball. Over the course of the days, she starts using her telekineses as well as other powers more and more in day to day things as well, slowly growing more comfortable with it all.

One night, the subject of ship security is also brought up. Considering Galen was kidnapped right from the ship, they’re concerned about that happening again and this sparks a discussion on how they were able to find Galen in the first place. It doesn’t take the crew long to deduce that they’re tracking Galen through the watch.

This brings up a discussion on how to best deal with the watch, some of the crew suggesting they could plant it on someone else to throw Saedra and the Council of Galen’s trail, though not everyone’s comfortable with putting a target on someone else’s back. Taking a look at the watch, Bonzo deduces that Galen simply taking it off and not using it would also mean Saedra can’t track him.

Rydia suggests perhaps they can give the watch to the Sensos family, who seemed to not like Saedra or any undead affiliates, which the group eventually agree on.
