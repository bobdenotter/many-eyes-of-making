# Orc Aboard

Not long after what happened at the hotel, the group finds themselves at Madame Ghallanda’s Glamorously Gratifying Delights. One by one, the group is escorted into a room where Rosevyr Ghallanda is waiting for them, Beck the last one to find himself waiting to be retrieved. A red-haired woman wearing a turquoise robe comes walking up to him, introducing herself as Velvet. “Will you follow me?”

Having seen the others head in that same direction, Beck follows Velvet, who leads him to well-lit cellar. There’s a large banner on the wall, featuring the contours of a blink dog - House Ghallanda’s sigil. There’s comfortable red couches, leather chairs and a saloon table filled with papers, which is where the rest of the party is seated.

Velvet looks over the entire party, lingering around a little longer than expected, so Rosevyr asks her what’s the matter. “I was just wondering if I could get you or your friends here some drinks,” Velvet offers, an offer which Rosevyr declines, and so Velvet takes her leave.

They’re then left alone with Rosevyr, who has been catching Galen and Rydia up on the plans regarding the train that’s leaving soon. She’s told them there’s a shipment leaving for Aundair that the Sisters of Sin, to which this brothel belongs, would like to have. They’re not sure what this shipment is, they simply know it’s valuable.

She draws everyone’s attention to the papers on the table, where they see a rough composition of what the train will look like. Rosevyr also tells them that she’s managed to purchase four tickets, and that the rest of the tickets have been purchased; it seems a lot of people want to leave Gatherhold, considering all the deaths that happened during the festival.

“Well, what is the plan?” she then asks the group, and after asking some more questions, the group start theorizing about what the best course of action might be. Rydia and Galen both keep quiet, seemingly thinking the air ship crew are familiar with these kind of jobs and they’ll know what to do.

Looking at a map, and realising the air ship isn’t quite as fast as the lightning rail, they eventually decide that they’ll send the airship ahead, and they’ll try and retrieve this shipment preferably before the lightning rail reaches Vedykar.

The captain also notes a gap between Rekkenmark and Thaliost; which Rosevyr knows is because there used to be a great big bridge over that river, but during the last war it got destroyed. Ever since the war, Thrane and Karrnath absolutely hate each other, which has led to extensive checks at the border. The entire train gets unloaded at Rekkenmark and gets put on ferries, after which everything gets unloaded again at Thaliost and the train continues on its way.

“Seeing as they are Aundarians, they probably won’t want to rouse suspicion of any Karrnathians; if things get lost before they get to Thaliost, they probably won’t start complaining til they’re in Thaliost,” the captain points out, before she turns to Galen and Rydia, asking if they have anything to add.

Galen and Rydia both point out they’re not experts, though Galen does warn them about entering Karrnath territory. Rydia suggests that perhaps when the train passes near the Mournland might be a point of interest or perhaps a weak spot as well.

When Rydia asks if they know more about what they’re stealing, Rosevyr says that they don’t know much, but she does know that it’s information. She explains that they deal in information, not in artefacts, so if the information is engraved on stones, there’s no need for them to bring those; they simply have to remember the information. She also tells them that two wagons will be tacked on later, and what they’re looking for will be in those two wagons, which will narrow down their search.

These wagons will be tacked on quite early, coming from the old railroad that would’ve gone to Metrol. D4 suggests that perhaps they can blow up the tracks the two wagons would need to come across, with Beck suggesting it might be easier to just release whatever holds the wagons together after they’ve been attached.

Rosevyr also shares that they know that the person involved in the selling of this item is already in town. His name is Errold ir’Lain, also known as His Majesty Prince Minute Errold of house Lain. Beck points out that, if anything, he wants to get a look at Errold, so Rosevyr describes him. Meanwhile, D4 recalls that the Lain family is responsible for the Knights Arcane, an elite group of soldiers that are also trained in magic.

They’re also told that the item will likely be heavily guarded, likely by warforged, considering the fact the shipment is coming from the Mournland. D4 asks if they should just get on the train here in Gatherhold, which Beck agrees to, though he insists they go see Errold first. When Galen asks him why, Beck simply makes himself look like Galen for a moment. “If I see someone, I can make myself look like someone,” he explains, to which Galen says that’s unnerving and Rydia says she cannot tell him what she’s thinking right now.

Beck and D4 decide to head out to try and find Errold, though the captain points out they should also make a plan on where they’ll meet up. They discuss that ideally, they’ll get to the shipment before Vedykar, to which Galen asks them if they know about Karrnath. He shares some information about the place; saying they have something of a military tradition in Karrnath. “I’m just worried who might get on the train in Vedykar,” he points out, to which Rydia suggests another plan of action: they could try and cut the additional wagons off before they reach the train.

The plan of blowing up the tracks is brought up again, though Beck points out that lacks subtlety; they won’t be able to do any of that unnoticed. Though Rosevyr doesn’t care much about whether or not they’re subtle; she just needs this to not be traced back to her. She and her sisters just want the information, which they will then sell to the highest bidder.

They essentially conclude they don’t know how many guards there are going to be, Beck pointing out that if they blow up the tracks they’ll likely be fighting guards regardless, and they could risk damaging whatever the item might be.

Eventually, they decide to simply get on the train when it leaves the following day, and they’ll try to get to the shipment as early as possible. The captain also points out that there’s House Sivis contact points in almost every town, so they’ll be able to get in contact with the airship even if they wind up getting off the train earlier or later than expected. She then suggests they should get some more information first by taking a look at the papers they’ve been provided with and by maybe talking to Errold.

D4 suggests they agree to a rendez-vouz somewhere ahead of time, Rosevyr pointing out she can always contact her sisters in Thaliost to try and get a boat across the river for them, which will get them out of Karrnath. They wind up deciding on the air ship getting to Thaliost is Plan B, the captain and Petr heading out to prep the ship for travel. Before she leaves, she suggests Beck go talk to Errold, then turns to Galen and Rydia, asking them if they know anything more about Karrnath.

They seem somewhat reluctant to share information, though Galen does share a little bit. “It’s a country founded on strong military beliefs, mostly fueled by … let’s just say there’s a lot of undead there.” He also knows that getting stranded in the Nightwood is one of the worst things that can happen, but he doesn’t share this with the others. Rydia does say she’s not a big fan of the Nightwood, but doesn’t divulge more than that.

With somewhat of a plan formed, Beck and D4 head to the Gold Dragon Inn hotel to see if they can find Errold there. Beck takes on another one of his personas, switching to Flynn. D4 asks if he can make himself look like D4 as well; which Beck says he can, though he thinks that maybe he won’t feel like he’s made out of metal.

Once they get to the hotel, there’s two halflings seemingly arguing about something. D4 overhears them talking about a recent theft; after a cleaning inspection something was reported missing. The one halfling is getting a stern talking to, though whatever it was that got stolen doesn’t seem to have been of much value. Beck approaches the front desk, asking the halfling behind it if they know where he might be able to find Errold, claiming Madame Ghallanda sent him. They tell him he’s at the breakfast buffet, so Beck and D4 make their way over there.

They find Errold there, talking to a dwarf. There aren’t many patrons left there, as it’s rather late in the morning. Errold is indeed easy to recognise; he’s chunky, wearing a long, flat-brimmed hat with a purple banner around it. He’s wearing a purple cape with golden trimming; his beard is sculpted into weird squiggly lines. The dwarf he’s talking to is bald, has a massive tattoo running over his skull and a thick, white beard. He’s wearing brownish robes.

D4 says he’ll stay out of sight, waiting at the bar as Beck approaches, taking a seat at a table near the two men are talking. He tries to overhear some of their conversation, but isn’t able to pick up on much, largely due to a halfling server who comes up to him, offering him some milk, which distracts Beck from the conversation.

Still watching the two men, Beck realises that he recognises the tattoo on the man’s head. It’s a dragonmark, not a tattoo, and it’s of House Kundarak; the house of Warding. It’s the house one connects with if one wishes to keep information, prisoners or valuables safe. Beck also recognises the robes from somewhere, but he’s not sure where from; it’s something to do with House Kundarak, an organization within the dragonmarked house.

They’re still discussing something, quietly so, so Beck carefully casts Detect Thoughts, trying to get more of an idea of what they’re talking about. He’s unable to detect any of the dwarf’s thoughts, but does get the surface thoughts of Errold. Errold’s base emotion seems to be slight nervousness, with a hint of greed.

The dwarf eventually starts grabbing something out of his bag; a small box. As he does this, Errold stops eating, wipes his mouth and then reaches into his robe to pull out a small book. He hands this book to the dwarf, who puts it in the box, which D4 notices is lined with lead. He then gets up, taking a bow before walking away.

As he comes by D4 as he leaves, D4 addresses him, asking him to have a drink with him as a fellow dwarven friend. D4 holds up his mug, which seems to spark the dwarf’s interest. He asks D4 where he got the mug, to which D4 says he thinks he got it somewhere in the Mournland. Though he seems interested, the dwarf excuses himself, saying he’s on a very sacred duty, so he doesn’t have time. He seems excited about his mission. He does agree to drinks next time they’re in town, though when D4 asks his name, he’s unwilling to give it.

With the dwarf then leaving, Beck approaches Errold. He tells Errold they have a mutual friend at House Ghallanda, extending an invitation for him to come back. He also promises Errold that he’ll be there if he does come back again, making some more small talk before taking his leave again.

He meets back up with D4 in the lobby and the two of them share what they found. Beck theorizes the dwarf might be part of the security detail of whatever item this was as D4 mentions the dwarf was interested in his mug. Beck suggests he has now seen and heard enough of Errold he can likely pretend to be him. They then head back to the ship to meet up with the others.

The captain says that she and Petr are ready to go, saying they’re heading towards the corner of the Mournland near Fort Bright. She also suggests they agree to a signal; D4 says he can leave a green light on top of the train if they got off early, and he can make the light red if they haven’t made it yet and they need to be picked up later along the track. She and Petr then take the airship, heading out to the agreed upon location.

The others head back to the hotel, getting rooms, seeing as they no longer have an airship to sleep in. Everyone retreats to their rooms, Galen taking a look at the watch he pocketed. Rydia comments on the watch; “So when the big hand is on the 12, its a full hour. They’re really not that hard to figure out.” When Galen asks her if she has any questions about this, Rydia lists a number of them. The two of them briefly discuss how apparently their new friends don’t seem experienced with train heists, before Galen says he’s never met Mortem before. “Somebody’s apparently interested in keeping me alive,” he then says, to which Rydia points out she does like him alive.

Galen then holds up the watch, asking her if she recognises the design. The gold skull is familiar to her, she recognises it from the mask wearing woman. “It seems like a bad person to be taking gifts from,” Galen points out, adding that he’s worried they might use this to find them. “They found us without using that,” Rydia says, before saying it’s none of her business. She doesn’t know if it’s worth using, but certainly doesn’t mind it keeping him alive. She also points out that if there was a price attached, they should’ve mentioned it.

Reminding Rydia of what Mortem asked about, Galen then asks her to promise him something. “You never ever tell anyone wearing one of these, anything about that.” Rydia does promise this. They then reminisce about how things could be worse, considering all the things they’ve been through recently.

Rydia then mentions Beck can turn into Galen now, Galen asking if that means she’s gonna invite him over. “That seems a bit early; let’s call that plan C.” They then turn their attention to plan A and B instead.

The following morning, they all have breakfast before heading towards the station. Galen gets up early, taking some time to attune to the watch before joining the others. Rydia uses some of the breakfast buffet to assemble some treats and then they all head towards the station.

Gatherhold station is a little ways outside of town, considering a train rails can’t really venture into canyons. There’s an excited hustle and bustle around the station of people wanting to leave; there’s a few lingering passengers as well who just arrived. As they near the station, Galen spots a familiar figure: Velvet, the woman working for Rosevyr. She’s dressed casually, looking around and seemingly hasn’t spotted any of the group yet.

She starts walking back into the shadows, inbetween the main station building and the large storage hangars that are at the back of the station. Galen nudges Beck, drawing his attention to this as well, suggesting that Beck can follow, as he can make himself look like someone who Velvet hasn’t seen yet.

Beck heads into the station hall a little, ducking into a corner as he lifts up the hood of his cloak, then lowers it again, changing his appearance, making himself look like Lux. He then meets up with Galen again, who’s been keeping an eye on where Velvet went, and Beck then follows after her. He tries to do so quietly, but as he approaches where Velvet seems to be waiting on something or someone, he stumbles over some derelict train parts, making a lot of noise.

This alerts Velvet to his presence, who starts running away from him. Galen gives chase as Beck hangs back, pointedly moving into the spot Velvet was in before taking on her appearance. As Galen soon catches up to Velvet, Rydia and D4 hang back, wondering what the other two are up to.

Velvet tries to climb over a fence to get away from Galen, but he manages to pull her down, grabbing hold of her. She looks up at him, scared, realising she’s been caught. Galen asks her to tell him what she was doing, and he watches as her entire composition and facial expression changes to something much blander. “To be honest, I came to see if you got on board the train correctly. My madame had heard of your little meeting in the Golden Dragon Inn, with the undead man.”

She explains that Rosevyr made a deal with the airship crew, not knowing that Rydia and Galen would be part of this deal as well. “She hired the crew of the Heritage; she had no idea you were part of that.” She doesn’t so much have a problem with Galen or Rydia (yet), nor does she have a problem with Karrnath. Galen points out that if Rosevyr has a personal issue with him, then she should tell him. “The meeting in the Golden Dragon was a personal matter; it has nothing to do with this mission.” Velvet says she’ll pass this along.

Meanwhile, Beck watches as an orc appears out of a hole in the wall of the massive hangar in front of him, carrying a massive, fancy suitcase. “That’s a great disguise,” the orc comments. “Too bad it’s going to go away.” He then hands him the suitcase, before saying he was never here. Beck says he understands, accepting the suitcase, and the orc crawls back into the hole.

Galen and Velvet then make their way back towards the station, Galen very deliberately putting his arm around her waist and guiding her back. Changing back, Beck is heading back towards D4 and Rydia, bringing the suitcase with him and trying to stay ahead of Galen and Velvet. They do still see his figure leaving the alley way.

As they exit the alley way, Beck simply pretends the suitcase he was given is his, seemingly managing to do so convincingly enough to make Velvet believe this. Velvet wishes them good luck on their endeavor, saying she’ll inform lady Rosevyr that everything is okay. Rydia asks Velvet came from, Galen saying she was just keeping an eye on them.

With Velvet taking her leave, Galen then asks Beck about the suitcase. “Some orc gave it to me,” Beck explains, saying it seems it was meant for Velvet. Beck shares what the orc said word for word, Rydia and Galen noting that the orc complimented Velvet’s disguise, suggesting that she’s able to disguise herself, perhaps in a similar way Beck can.

Beck then opens the suitcase, finding various sets of clothes, notably one set that looks almost exactly like what Errold was wearing the previous day. This includes a house signet ring. There’s also some off beat weird leather armor, a scimitar in a scabbard, as well as two strange vials with a milky white liquid inside and a set of thieves’ tools.

Galen takes a look at the liquid, but doesn’t recognise it; Rydia opens one of the vials and smells it, but doesn’t recognise the scent either. It smells very strong, acidic and generally doesn’t smell very nice. “I don’t think this is a new cocktail they were trying to discover,” Rydia comments, which the others agree with.

“Somehow, I don’t think we’re the only ones going after this thing,” Galen then points out, which seems obvious to the rest of the group as well. They all head to the train then, Galen pulling Rydia aside as they head over. “She was asking about Mortem,” Galen shares, but they don’t really get the chance to discuss it much further than that.

Boarding the train, they find their seats in the second wagon. Most of the train is busy, packed with people trying to leave the festival; a lot of people install themselves and simply head directly into the bar. They can see Errold boarding a little up ahead, heading into the first class wagon. He has an entourage with him; a woman clad in golden armor with purple accents, that has a wand in a holster and a longsword to her side. Beck and D4 also recognise the dwarf they noticed yesterday, boarding the same wagon as Errold.

In the carriage they’re in, most of the people seem to be common folk. Right before the train starts to leave, a man enters who stands out, occupying the last two seats in the back. He has red hair, a red beard, wearing familiar golden armor with purple accents. He’s accompanied by a metallic dog.

Before long, the train starts to crackle with lightning as it starts to pick up speed and it leaves the station. Though the wagon they’re in is in good condition, the wagon is pretty cramped; the group is sitting relatively close to other people, though sooner rather than later people get up to grab themselves some drink.

Taking a look at the golden armored man, D4 recognises the colors as those of the Knights Arcane. “They must be protecting the place,” he points out as Galen takes a look around the wagon they’re in, trying to see if anyone’s paying particular attention to them. The red-haired man is mostly minding his own business as he keeps an eye on everybody; he doesn’t seem to be specifically watching the group.

D4 watches out the window as the train speeds along, clearly enjoying this new experience, as he’s never been on a train before. He then heads towards the bar, testing whether or not they can just leave their wagon, which they seem to can just fine. The bar is not entirely filled up, but it’s fairly crowded. There’s a halfling behind the bar, pouring drinks for those inside the bar.

Both Beck and Rydia join D4 at the bar, D4 ordering drinks for all of them. No one seems to be paying particular attention to them being here. D4 asks about some good oil as well, the barkeep saying they have some lamp oil in the back. He continues talking to the barkeep, making small talk. The barkeep explains they don’t stop by Gatherhold as often as they used to, they only stop here about once a week.

The door opens up then, and D4 can see the dwarf from yesterday morning enter, coming in for a drink as well. He orders a stout, then recognises D4, greeting him. The dwarf asks if he can have some beer out of the mug that D4 showed yesterday, which D4 agrees to, handing the dwarf the mug. “Well I suppose now you’ve earned my name. Name’s Vornak d’Kundarak.” D4 gives him a false name in return: D8.

Vornak says he’s doing well, it’s just a short ride for him today as he’s heading for Vedykar. D4 asks what brings him there, but though he’s now given his name, Vornak is still unwilling to divulge a lot more details. As the two of them talk, Beck notices a ring on Vornak’s finger. It’s two encircled bands of chains that Beck recognises, putting two and two together from the robes he recognised yesterday. He realises this dwarf might be with the Chained Library.

He knows this to be a hidden place, run by the Mark of Warding. It’s a library where they keep all sorts of hidden knowledge that is deemed too dangerous for public knowledge or public use. The library is supposedly very well guarded.

Feeling like he can’t really talk whilst so close to Vornak, Beck excuses himself and heads back to join Galen in the other wagon, sitting down next to him. In a hushed voice, he shares what he just saw and what he just realised with Galen. Galen is actually somewhat familiar with the Chained Library; it is a thing of legends. He knows it likely exists, because it’s tied to a dragonmarked house. He knows that a certain someone was adamant about getting in there.

It’s a famed library, which has what is called the Howling Stacks; an entire section of sentient books that try to corrupt mortals the minute they get close enough. It’s sort of a heresy to burn this knowledge and get rid of it; it is deemed important enough to keep, but it should be kept away from most prying eyes. That is the purpose of the library. Galen knows that there’s two potential locations for this library; its either is in the ironroot mountains, in the Mror Holds, or it’s in the Icetop Mountains in Karrnath. The former makes more sense, but it being a secret library doesn’t rule out the second location either.

Galen also knows that everybody at the Library of Korenberg hates the Chained Library; they thought it was horrible to keep knowledge secret. They’ve started a smearing campaign of sorts in academic circles, aimed at the Chained Library. “Well I mean it’s not just a regular library, y’know,” Galen says, to which Beck points out he’s more concerned about how this might limit their time of what they need to do, considering Vornak mentioned he’d be getting off at Vedykar.

As they’re discussing this, the train starts to slow down. Galen points out that if somebody working for the Chained Library wants that information, the information might be dangerous. “If Velvet isn’t working for House Ghallanda, then who the hell are we delivering this information to?” Beck suggests if they deliver the information to Rosevyr in person, they can circumvent that, mentioning there’s ways to figure out if someone’s pretending to be someone else as well. Galen points out that he just thinks they should be careful, as he’s not sure who they can trust now.

“I just hope it’s something we can read,” Beck points out, saying he hopes that they can just find what they need, read it, and leave it in place so they can leave everyone else involved none the wiser. They notice the red-haired man moving on to another cart, also realising that considering the fact the train is slowing down, the extra carts will likely be tacked on any time now.

Meanwhile, D4 is still enjoying his conversation with Vornak, who’s being pleasant, though he changes the subject whenever his occupation comes up. D4 asks Vornak if he knows why they’re slowing down, deducing that Vornak genuinely seems unaware of why this is happening. Vornak even claims he’s not seen a train come from that direction since before the war. As he looks outside the window, D4 doesn’t see much, but as he points out to Rydia that something’s happening outside, she notices a person clinging to the side of the train they’re currently in.

Both of them do also see the two wagons approaching, seemingly thrust forward by five warforged. The wagons look rusty and old. Rydia also sees that the person hanging off the side of the train seems to be throwing continuous spells at the approaching warforged. This person is a man, clad in leather armor.

The train is nearly slowed down to a halt, before everyone feels a slight push, the extra wagons seemingly connecting and the train then speeding up again. The man on the side of the train then ducks back inside.

Rydia points out she’s curious about all this, then says she’s bored. She puts her glass down, then heads all the way down to the sixth wagon, D4 heading after her. Vornak asks if he can hold on to the mug for a moment, D4 saying he can’t, taking it back. Rydia puts some gold down for another drink for Vornak and then the two of them head down to the sixth wagon.

As they pass through the fifth wagon, they see mostly common folk; no one really stands out. There’s a man sleeping under a blanket of sorts, but it doesn’t seem anything out of the ordinary. In the sixth wagon, they still see some common people, though they also quickly notice there’s about three warforged now stationed in the wagon as well. Two of them seem to be guarding the door towards the newly added wagons; where they’re standing there’s scattered goods as well, belonging to merchants that are also on the train.

Rydia walks up to the door that leads to the newly attached wagons; the two warforged addressing her and saying she can’t come through there. “This is private property of House ir’Lain.” Rydia tells them she’s just curious, asking them if they’re just here to guard this private property. They confirm this.

She continues trying to talk to them, but they don’t give her much. As she’s talking to them, she casually leans against the door that leads to the other carts, looking through the window that lets her look outside. Sadly, she can’t see much through it, as there are no windows on the carts that were just attached. “I’ll go back to my boring day, thanks for not making it better,” Rydia then says, heading back to join the others again in the second wagon.

As she and D4 make their way back, they pass by the man sleeping under a blanket again. As they pass by this man, D4 gets a better look at the man, suddenly realising he looks familiar. The man asleep under the blanket is Dugorim, the one he and the others initially met aboard the airship, who he knows is part of the Daask.
