# Gambling Problem
As Petr turns to Lina, asking her about how well she knows Thelos and if she’s able to tell if this is really him, ‘Thelos’ himself starts making his way towards his office, suggesting he’ll start cleaning there. Both Beck and Galen instantly offer to help him, moving towards him. ‘Thelos’ questions their behaviour, after which Beck makes himself look like Thelos as well. He casts Detect Magic, at first assuming this person might be a changeling like him, though the Detect Magic reveals a disguise spell. 

‘Thelos’ then says he’s simply here for his spellbook and when Beck asks who’s spellbook he’s here for, he says the one that’s soon to be his. Another figure then appears from across the room, holding a knife to Esme’s throat as he drags her inside with him. With ‘Thelos’ disguise now certainly revealed, combat ensues, with ‘Thelos’ attempting to get away from where some of the group are near him.

Beck follows, with Bonzo focusing on the figure near Esme, trying to hit it. It doesn’t work though, leaving him to conclude something’s off about this whole situation. Once Beck swipes at ‘Thelos’, the image of Esme and the thug disappears, revealing that to have been an illusion. They corner ‘Thelos’, intimidating them into dropping their disguise, revealing a fancy looking elf instead. 

She claims she meant no harm, then casts a Charm Person spell, which everyone except Beck manages to shake off. Lina, not amused by the mere idea of someone threatening her wife, casts Hold Person on this elf and the group then interrogates her.

They find out her name is Ravalla and she works for House Thurani. She was supposed to pick up the spellbook and take it back to the Anvil; Thelos needs it to make the potion he’s been working on that allows you to traverse the Mournland. Galen asks Lina if Thelos was working on anything else, if maybe they needed him for something as well.

Lina says that as far as she knows that’s not the case, before pointing out there’s something else that concerns her more: the image of Esme that Ravalla conjured up was wearing the same clothes that Esme herself was wearing last night. 

Prompted by this, Rydia tries to send a message to Esme, but gets no response. She deduces that she might be magically protected somewhere, sharing this with the rest of the group. Not amused by the fact that his best friend seems to have been taken, Galen shows Ravalla his arm before pressing her with some more questions.

Ravalla shares that last night’s burglary of the tower here was a distraction; their real target was Esme. They decided that between Lina and Esme, the latter was the easier target. She’s currently in the Anvil, where they brought her after taking her captive. They asked her about the mission and she’s the one who told them about Thelos, after which they also captured Thelos. 

Beck wonders out loud how it’s possible that Rydia was able to contact Thelos but not Esme, Ravalla claiming that she doesn’t know. As Rydia uses Detect Thoughts, she finds out that Ravalla does know; she’s thinking of strange, doglike creatures that have magical whisps floating around them. She shares this image, much to Ravalla’s surprise, and with that description Galen recognises they might be spellhounds. 

Deciding the Anvil is where they need to go next, Petr shares what he knows about the place. It’s run by the Boromar clan, but House Thurani also makes a habit of performing there. There’s a large front entrance, as well as a smaller door inside in the back. 

The discussion soon turns to whether or not they should bring Ravalla, Beck, who is still charmed by her, honestly not seeing why they shouldn’t. The non charmed members of the group decide it’s best to leave her here, Lina calling out to her colleagues and asking them to keep an eye on Ravalla. She also goes to retrieve the spellbook that Ravalla was here for, pulling a gem from her pocket and casting a spell before putting the spellbook away in a habersack. 

She gives the gem to Galen, telling him that if they lose track of the spellbook, he simply has to crush the gem and it will return to his hands. 

With Ravalla being watched after by Lina’s colleagues, the group heads out to try and find transport to the Anvil. Most skycoach drivers seem unwilling to take them all the way there, but they find one that drops them off relatively nearby. Beck, now no longer charmed, changes his outfit to match this lower ward better.

As they walk through this ward towards the Anvil, they see just how much of a lower ward this really is. Everything looks dilapidated, with only little sunlight making it’s way down from all the way above. 

After a brief discussion, the group decides to split up, with Beck (disguised as Ravalla), Rydia and Bonzo heading in through the front door and Petr, Galen and Lina sneaking in through the back. Bonzo leaves Betsy outside, hoping to call her in as soon as trouble starts. 

Heading inside, they move past a coat collection area, where Beck spots a coat that matches a little better with what Ravalla was wearing. He takes it, convincing a guard that pops his head in that it’s definitely his, before making his way further inside. Rydia and Bonzo follow, pretending to just be clients of the bar. 

As they move further in, they’re met with a largely empty place except for a halfling man and two burly fellows accompanying him. The halfing recognises ‘Ravalla’, asking if she got what she was looking for. ‘Ravalla’ tells him yes, attempting to Major Image the book, but the halfling catches on and tells her to stop messing around. 

He then informs her that her companions went elsewhere, as ‘the mage’ requested a work space, though he’s vague on where exactly they went. When asked, he explains it’s not because he doesn’t want to share, he just doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know; that’s House Thurani business and he doesn’t want to get involved. He does share that someone else from House Thurani is still here and this person could tell Ravalla where they went, calling out for someone named Valindra. 

Meanwhile, Rydia has found a spot at the bar and orders a drink, Bonzo soon joining her and asking for a drink as well. Outside, Petr, Galen and Lina discuss how to best get past the guard that’s by the back door. 

Valindra soon pokes her head out from behind a curtain, recognising ‘Ravalla’ and calling her over. Behind the privacy of the curtain, she tells ‘Ravalla’ that they took the wizard to a secret lab of their client in the Bazaar in middle Dura, a location that Beck is familiar with as it’s linked to House Cannith. When asked, she reveals that Esme is still here, upstairs somewhere. 

Upstairs, where Petr, Galen and Lina have found their way after Galen knocked out the guard out front. They sneak their way through a hallway, listening for sounds by the doors until Galen picks up on some slight growling a little further through the building. He starts picking a lock as Rydia, through Sending, checks in with both Beck and Galen, asking them both if everything is alright. 

Beck shares what Valindra just told him, Valindra herself having retreated to her dressing room to prepare for a show, and Galen shares what he and the others have since found upstairs. Right after catching everyone up, the guard that Galen knocked unconscious stumbles his way back into the downstairs room where Rydia and Bonzo are seated at the bar, alerting his boss of intruders.

This prompts said boss, Therrad the halfling that ‘Ravalla’ spoke to upon walking in as well, to call for security, a number of halfling guards rushing into the room in no time. At the mention of intruders, Valindra pokes her head out from the curtain again, pointing in the direction of Bonzo and Rydia, saying she doesn’t think those two can be trusted.

Rydia responds by summoning an aberration and combat soon ensues. As Rydia’s aberration (lovingly named Abby) attacks and Beck joins the fight by grabbing his amulet and slamming his hand down on the floor (casting Destructive Wave), Galen finds his way to the room where the growling sounds were coming from. Looking inside, he spots Esme bound and gagged on the floor. She’s accompanied by two of these spellhounds as well as a single guard, and it’s not long before a fight breaks out upstairs as well. 

Downstairs, the beholder like machine that the group spotted earlier joins for combat, Therrad making his way towards the machine and climbing inside. It’s not long until Rydia finds her way to where he is though, opening the hatch and attacking the halfling as Bonzo finds himself in a fire fight with the guard that came running back into the room. 

Galen, meanwhile, shoots at the guard in the room with Esme, his left hand moving of its own accord after he hits, shooting necrotic damage at one of the spellhounds. Petr runs in to join the fight as well, with Lina not far behind, but it’s not long until the guard changes tactics and points his gun at Esme instead, threatening her.

He urges Galen and Petr to drop their weapons, which they do, though as soon as the guard relaxes a little and moves the gun away from Esme’s head, Galen starts boiling the guard’s blood. Petr whacks at the spellhound, who instantly sniffs out Galen’s magical hand and rushes at him. 

Back downstairs, Rydia sends Abby after Valindra, who tries to get away as Bonzo addresses those still standing, which is just the one guard and Therrad at this point. He convinces them to stand down and with the situation here seemingly under control, Beck uses that change to Dimension Door upstairs, looking for where the others are. He finds Lina in the hallway, face to face with one of the spellhounds and Thunder Stepping away from it. 

Galen and Petr take care of the guard and the spellhound in the room with them, Petr then walking out and dealing with the spellhound in the hallway as well and with that, most of the combat seems to be resolved.
