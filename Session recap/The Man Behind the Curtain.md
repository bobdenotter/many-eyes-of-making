# The Man Behind the Curtain

 
Galen’s words hang on the air for a moment, the sound of the rain bouncing off the deck intensifying in the silence. “There’s a few options,” Beck suggests, pointing out they still have the Dream Lily as Galen points out nothing good comes from going to Metrol. Orryn also sends people into the Mournland, however it seems like those people aren’t fully protected from the effects of entering what remains of Cyre.

  

As they discuss this, the ship tilts violently, taken by a gust of wind as the group are sent skidding, Rydia and D4 knocked over by the movement. The ship rolls violently in the storm, the anchor keeping them somewhat tied down and they’re buffetted by the wind. As they get their bearings, the group can hear some loud thuds on the deck and the roof of the Captain’s Quarters, Galen looking out the windows to see the deck covered in mist, carried by the breeze. In the mist, there are some patches of strange grey sludge. Galen opens the door, the wind catching the wood and blasting the entrance open. There’s a wailing sound in the mist, and within the mist are faces, reminiscent of what they saw as they sailed past the Mournland. “This is why people don’t go to Metrol,” Galen points out as he pulls out his gun, taking a shot at the nearest creature. It impacts, sending some of the sludge scattering across the deck as a blue bolt shoots from Galen’s stomach, hitting the first creature and bouncing off to impact a second.

  

More creatures land on deck, joined by some yellow looking creatures as the rest of the party rush forward to defend the ship, some of their armour damaged by the acid of the attacks from the creatures. Beck rushes to raise the anchor as Rydia moves into the middle of deck, tentacles erupting as she attacks the group of creatures. One of the creatures moves towards Beck, who thinks he sees the face of Yasmin in the ooze as it attacks. The Captain rushes towards the wheel, grabbing hold and beginning to steer the ship away from the mists as the party do their best to hold out against the assault. On her orders, D4 heads below deck to get the engine running on full, trying to get away as fast as possible.

  

Under assault from multiple creatures, Rydia is knocked unconscious on deck, the yellow ooze beginning to feed on her as she’s down. Galen rushes to her defence, destroying one of the oozes as Beck calls out to Rydia to heal her, whilst trying to defend the Captain as she rights the ship and steers them away. Petr blasts two more of the creatures off the ship as Beck is himself knocked unconscious, the creatures swarming towards him as a result. The Captain moves to defend him, deflecting a blow from one of the creatures as it tries to finish him off. Petr manages to use a healing spirit to rescue him as an exhausted Rydia finishes off the last remaining creature with an Eldritch Blast.

  

The ship steering away from the last of the mist, the wind begins to die down as they continue on their way south, the effects of the Mournland receding back to Cyre. At Petr’s encouragement, the party make good use of his Healing Spirit, taking a few moments to catch their breath after the unexpected assault. Petr asks where the creatures came from, Beck and Galen explaining that’s part of the effect of the Mournland. Petr agrees going to Metrol is more of a consideration in that case, before the exhausted group agree to rest up and any further discussions can wait until the morning. The group head to their bunks, although Rydia remains on deck, still pale and not responding to Galen’s concerned question. Exhausted, Galen heads to bed anyway and the crew take the night to recover from the events of the last day.

  

The next morning, D4 is at the helm as they approach Gatherhold, a few hours away from town. As they sail through, Petr spots a circle of vultures off the side of the ship, and what appears to be a figure on the ground nearby. Petr points out the vultures to D4, noting that’s odd given he saw vultures in his dream, asking if they should go check it out. Letting the Captain sleep, they start to slow down the ship so that Petr can have a look. Whilst Galen is below deck repairing his gun, and Rydia elsewhere on deck, Beck approaches Petr as the ship begins to slow and descend, asking if they’re heading down. Petr points out the vultures, explaining that he had a dream where he met his sister in Metrol, and there were vultures there, wanting to check it out. Beck asks about that, Petr saying he wanted to talk to Beck anyway, as when he woke up, there was a raven carrying a note that tells them not to trust Rydia.

  

Petr pulls out the note, showing it to Beck and explaining the wording given the note is written in Druidic. Beck asks if Petr knows the Gatekeepers, the organisation that signed the note, which Petr confirms he doesn’t. Beck however, knows that the Gatekeepers are an historic group, involved in Druidic magic and dating back to the time of the Dhakaani Empire. They ward and guard the planet against the Daelkyr, the wars of the Daelkyr the thing that finished off the goblin empire of Dhakaan many centuries ago. This was effectively an invasion from the plane of Xoriat, a number of aberrations arriving in Khorvaire. The Gatekeepers guard and lock all of the Manifest Zones to Xoriat to this end, guaring Khorvaire against invasion.

  

Petr says if that’s true, that probably makes the Gatekeepers the ‘good guys’, then maybe they should trust them, but Rydia hasn’t given them much reason to doubt her. “So far she’s odd, for lack of a better word, but she doesn’t seem disloyal.” Beck agrees they haven’t been given a reason not to trust her, but the Gatekeepers still want to see him. Petr suggests he go and meet them, although the new moon isn’t for another week or so. Beck agrees he’s curious, but they don’t know the Gatekeepers any better than Rydia. “How well do we know Rydia?” Petr asks, as Beck agrees it’s equally not well, as they know practically nothing about her. She hasn’t exactly volunteered information about things. “There’s something going on there, but I don’t know if they know any more than we do,” Beck points out, before concluding it’s probably worth seeing what the Gatekeepers have to say, if even just out of curiosity.

  

Beck offers to stay close whilst Petr goes to the meeting, but Petr points out that the location mentioned in the note is the Eldeen Reaches, on the other side of Khorvaire. It would be a long journey to get there by airship, and they’d likely need to leave soon to get there on time. Petr asks if they could make a case to the Captain to head there, as Beck notes that convincing the Captain to go that way probably wouldn’t be the hard part. It would likely be more practical to head there by rail, but then there would be a significant amount of land to cross. Petr volunteers to go alone, pointing out if they mean him harm, they’re going to an unreasonable amount of trouble to do it. Beck agrees it doesn’t seem like they want to hurt him, Petr saying at the very least they might learn something about Rydia. Beck points out they could also just ask Rydia, although she might not answer. Petr suggests asking Galen when he’s alone, Beck pointing out there’s no harm in getting to know each other better. Remembering the Captain wanted to have dinner, Petr comes up with a plan. “Let’s put our best foot forward, make pleasant conversation and see if we can give them one glass of wine too many and see if they tell us anything.” Beck agrees they can at least try.

  

Asking about the dream Petr had, Petr confirms he used the Dream Lily, which took him to Metrol. He saw the ruins of the city along with some vultures which were circling his sister, whilst he also saw some other creatures. Petr confirms the Dream Lily works, Beck keen to try it out himself, although he points out maybe they should deal with the vultures first.

  

The ship coming to a stop, Galen and Rydia come to find out what’s going on, the closer angle letting the get a better view of the figure lying on the ground. Beck looks over the side of the ship, instantly recognising the figure as Velvet, covered in dirt and dressed in a nightgown. Galen also spots this after a few moments, her body in a horrible position, as if she was droppe. Beck heads down, closely followed by the rest of the party, although Petr chooses to float down instead of using the ladder.

  

There are feathers scattered the ground around her, her body twisted although she still has a full face of makeup. Beck recognises the impact is likely what killed her, her body covered in bruises, as Galen spots some wounds around her shoulders, as if something was pierced into her, like hooks or talons. Galen asks if this is the same woman they met, Beck saying that if someone like him dies, they revert to their normal form - Velvet hasn’t.

  

Galen asks if they want to talk to her, drawing some confusion from the group as Galen pulls out the Talenta Death Mask he found. Beck agrees it’s probably worth a shot, and there’s a brief discussion of what they want to ask her. Placing the mask over her eyes, the body twists and the head turns, her eyes turning black with two pinpricks of blue light. She turns towards Galen, who asks what happened to her. “I went into a room with a man. He looked handsome. When we were alone, his face changed to a strange blueish hue, and he slapped me and my light went out. I woke up being carried by two creatures.” Galen asks if she recognises him, but she confirms she has no idea who he is. Asking for suggestions, Galen eventually asks if there was anything distinct about the man. He didn’t have any markings, salt and pepper hair, with a small beard and a ponytail. Rydia glances at Petr, who matches the description fairly well, as Petr asks who the woman is. Galen asks her if she was working on anything for Rosevyr, but there was nothing special, any information she got was passed along. Beck points out it might be helpful to know what brought her here, as if they were harpies it could link them to the Daask. “They were winged women covered in feathers. They dropped me,” Velvet confirms on asking, and as her response finishes, the light in the eyes goes dim, the mask coming loose as she falls to the ground, dead once more.

  

Deciding to bury her, they find a spot in the hill, the grassland and savannah seeming as good as anywhere. Beck and Galen begin working on a grave, eventually burying her as Beck pulls out his amulet and says a quick prayer to Olladra, marking the grave as the group take a moment before they slowly start to move back towards the ship. Petr asks about Velvet, the group explaining she worked for Rosevyr, but it seems they met someone who was pretending to be her. Beck and Galen realise this was likely a doppleganger, their telepathic abilities providing an explanation for Velvet suddenly knowing Galens private business and fears. Doppelgangers are known to work within the Daask, as are the harpies, meaning Dugorim clearly had the same plan as Beck and the crew - when they intercepted ‘Velvet’, he had to come up with something else. Beck theorises they maybe seem to know a bit about them, given the description of the man could match Petr.

  

Returning to the ship, the group set about raising anchor and continuing on their way to Gatherhold, the Captain eventually waking to join them on deck. Beck asks if they should try the Dream Lily now, but Petr advises it might take some time, so would be best to try some other time.

  

Galen goes in search of Rydia, finding her on deck. He points out she seems better, and she apologises. “Sweater sometimes… rifles a bit,” she explains, and Galen confesses he’s just worried. She assures him that she’s fine now. “How long are we going to keep telling ourselves that?” Galen asks, as Rydia admits it’s getting harder to put it on. Galen asks why she does, a silence falling between them for a moment. Rydia points out he’s seen what she’s like, asking if he expects her to just not put it on. “I don’t want you to feel like you have to pretend for me, or spare my feelings, or something like that,” Galen explains. Rydia tells him she appreciates the gesture, before pausing for a moment, pointing out she has feelings about all this too. Galen agrees, but points out he’s seen her avoiding eye contact every time she’s like that. “It’s kind of hard to look at…” “The guy that got you into this mess?” Galen finishes for her. Before giving Rydia a chance to respond, he deflects, agreeing with her earlier statement that everything’s fine, and she’s right. They’re nearly back in town, so Galen suggests they go find the others, heading off to do so.

  

Approaching Gatherhold, they find a place to anchor as D4 volunteers to stay on board and get to work repairing some of the acid damage the Heritage took. Beck offers to find some lead for the ship, promising to buy some in town for him. With the bulk of the repairs made to their armour and weapons after the fight, the only other thing left to do in town is to complete their job for Rosevyr. Galen asks if they want to hand her the letters, Beck saying he wants to try the Dream Lily, to see if they can check out the train station in Metrol. Not seeing the connection, Galen asks what Beck’s deal is with Metrol, who quickly responds that he’s from there. Galen admits that explains some things, but Beck says the point is that if they go to Metrol they might be able to find more information on what the letters were talking about. Rydia asks if this means he’s suggesting they all take Dream Lily, which Beck says isn’t necessary, and it would likely be good to have someone to wake them up if it goes wrong anyway. Petr volunteers for babysitting duty, but Galen and Rydia seem less keen on taking part.

  

Galen asks if this means they don’t want to hand over the letters until after Beck’s checked out Metrol. Beck says the letters might not be all the information there is to find, and they might be able to discover something more for her if they check out Metrol. Galen asks how well they know Rosevyr, Beck asking if it matters. Galen impatiently points out they did what they were paid to do, and given they don’t know her past someone who hired them for a job, they should maybe exercise some caution in handing over information about something that everyone seems to be after.

  

“He used to be fun, I’m just getting that on the record,” Rydia interjects, although Galen mostly brushes this off, before Beck sighs and agrees they can go talk to Rosevyr, although Galen quickly says Beck can do whatever he wants. Beck points out he seems to have a strong opinion on this job that he apparently wasn’t interested in before. “I have a strong opinion on giving information to people that haven’t earned it.” Beck points out they have no idea what the information really is, and Galen contests that’s all the more reason that they don’t know who to trust with it. Interceding before things go any further, Rydia pulls Galen aside, asking if they can have a word.

  

Out of earshot of the others, Rydia asks what he’s doing, pointing out he’s not being a very gracious guest. Galen asks if he’s supposed to play the guest card now, but Rydia tells him that it’s maybe a little early to be second guessing their entire operation. Galen takes a moment to explain, stating that the letters are apparently about the same crystal Rydia saw. She gets uncomfortable at the mention of it, before getting back to her point. “You’re asking questions, but you’re not offering solutions. Even I’m annoyed at you right now.” Galen asks if she wants to know what’s going, explaining that Mortem Pent came asking about the book. Given Rydia’s visions lead to the crystal and apparently so the letters, Galen isn’t willing to let it fall into just anyone’s hands. Rydia tells him she’s not ready to have that conversation, Galen explaining he’s seen what happens when people get hold of things they shouldn’t have. “You’ve seen nothing,” Rydia responds darkly, her tone shifting for a moment before she apologises, pointing out if they intend to rely on these people, they need to do more than just ask questions every time they do something.

  

“If we don’t want them to kick us off their ship, maybe we should start explaining things instead of just asking things.” Galen points out they haven’t asked, but defensively offering to go and explain things to them, but Rydia’s already said she’s not ready for that conversation. She says she can just walk out the room when that happens. “Beck over there is being real patient with us right now, I would have kicked you off my ship twice already.” Rydia says that Galen knows how she feels about him, and she’s just trying to give him something she thinks he should know. Irritated, Galen says he’ll shut up and do whatever they want, Rydia complaining that’s not what she said, but the two return to the group regardless.

  

Leaving the ship, the group can see another train appears to be at the Lightning Rail station, which seems like an unscheduled arrival. As they move further through town, all sign of the festival is gone, the tents broken up and the city much emptier now. Heading towards Madame Ghallanda’s, things seem quiet, two of Rosevyr’s girls attempting to attract the attention of passers by. They allow the group inside as they move into the red velvet and golden interior of the establishment, the place quiet. There’s no visible patrons, with a few people lounging by the bar, and Evveryn is behind the bar, pouring drinks. Some more of the employees look over the balcony, but lose interest as they realise this is likely a business meeting. There’s a large curtain across part of the room, the candlelight showing the silhouette of a halfling woman talking to someone. Evveryn greets them, offering to tell Rosevyr they’ve arrived. He heads towards the curtain, telling Rosevyr the package has arrived. She follows Evveryn back to the main room, asking them to get the group some drinks as they take a seat, one of the girls getting ale for the group, although Galen requests something stronger.

  

Rosevyr asks how it went, Beck assuring her it went alright. He asks if she wants to go somewhere private, but Rosevyr assures her here is fine as Rydia uses Detect Thoughts, picking up a sense of nervousness from her. Beck tells Rosevyr they have what she’s looking for, but they also have some concerns. He tells her they found the body of one of her girls, Rosevyr asking if it’s Velvet, Rydia picking up on a sense of fear. Rosevyr says Velvet hasn’t returned since yesterday, and Beck tells her that the real Velvet likely hasn’t been there for a few days. Rydia tries to push deeper into her thought, but Rosevyr pushes her out before asking Beck what they found. Beck explains they ran into her at the train station, Rosevyr and Beck realising the impostor Velvet lingered long enough to learn their plans. Beck tells her they suspect it was the Daask, which Rosevyr doesn’t seem pleased about.

  

She asks if there was conflict on the train, Beck responding “we resolved the conflict”. She asks if they know what they know, and Beck says they don’t know for sure. Rosevyr leans closer, asking what they found as Beck takes a moment to glance between the Captain and Galen. The Captain nods, given they’re still doing a job, meanwhile Galen stops sulking in a glass of whiskey long enough to shrug. Beck explains he has one request before they do this, eventually negotiating using Petr’s Moonbeam spell to ensure that they don’t have any other dopplegangers around. Rosevyr refuses to let them hurt her employees, instead offering to send them away to their rooms. Petr casts his spell on Rosevyr, the white beam of light making her wince as it hits her, however she remains the same, confirming Rosevyr at least isn’t a doppleganger. Rosevyr then dismisses the rest of her staff, the group eventually dispersing. Galen watches to makes sure they all leave, confirming the room is empty - other than the guest behind the curtain who Rosevyr was previously talking to.

  

Beck asks about her guest, but Rosevyr says they can say whatever they want in front of him, as he’s the client. Beck challenges if she knows it’s really him, but she says she doesn’t care as the money is too good. Galen asks who it is, but Rosevyr insists it’s strictly confidential. Rydia telepathically asks Galen if she wants her to read his thoughts, but Galen unhelpfully tells her to do whatever she wants. As they debate this, the figure moves, standing up before coming around the edge of the curtain. “It’s fine Rosevyr, they can know who wants the information.” Beck immediately recognises the man who emerges as Jonah d’Cannith.
