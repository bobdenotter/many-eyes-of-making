# A Deep and Creeping Darkness

As the captain reaches for her crossbow, the massive sabretooth tiger bites at her, as the elf now speaks in common: “Now look what you've done, you've made her angry.” Fianin retaliates by trying to shoot an arrow right back at the beast, but she misses as Mapu, the tiger, swipes at her arm, causing the arrow to go wide.

Rydia looks over at Galen briefly before approaching, drawing a dagger which she uses to clean her nails as she looks over at the elf, his tiger and the captain. “There's no need for all this violence, is there?” she asks, Lukani chiming in from behind the bar, yelling at the elf: “Cirdan you fuck, get that massive beast out of here, I told you once already.” Cirdan raises up his hands, pointing out it seems they're outnumbered before he turns to the tiger, calming it down.

The captain, holding her bleeding hand, looks angry, though Galen manages to calm her down a little as he walks up to her. “I think we've got enough to deal with now, don't we, captain?” She agrees, turning her back on the elf and his tiger as Cirdan mutters under his breath in Elvish, which clearly stings the captain, but she continues walking away.

Telepathically, Rydia whispers something to Cirdan in Deep Speech, which he doesn't seem to understand, so it largely just leaves him confused. She winks at him, then walks away, joining Galen and the captain at the bar again.

Meanwhile Petr, after waking up from a mushroom induced slumber, joins Beck and D4 who are working on fixing up the ship. They've lowered the ship so that D4 can work on the bottom of the ship. Petr says he had the strangest dreams; ate one tiny mushroom, suddenly weird dreams everywhere. When D4 asks, he explains what dreams are. “I don't understand, can I eat mushrooms?” Petr doesn't think he can, but suggest they could make D4 some mushroom oil.

From where they're working on the ship, they spot a number of elven traders, as well as a handful of other people moving around the small town. D4 finishes up his work on the ship, then suggests they could sell some of the silver they found, which Beck agrees is a good idea.

They make their way over towards the vendors. Outside of the elven vendors there's a female dwarf, with behind her a large pack animal; a massive lizard, hidden under the shade of some trees, carrying a large number of burlap sacks. The woman has a darker skin color with deep wrinkles, clearly a native to this desert, and she's talking with one of the elves as D4 approaches her.

“Ah hello there, a fellow dwarf! I'm like you! Stout, barrelchested and short-legged” D4 points out, the dwarf seeming to appreciate his sense of humor. She asks if he came in with the airship, which D4 confirms, saying it was a beautiful trip. She says she's travelled the plains a few times herself. When asked what brings her here, she says she has some trade. She travels between the Mror holds and the jungle of Q'barra. She mainly deals in dragonshards.

She introduces herself as Lissann. D4 then says he has some spare parts on offer, asking if she'd be interested in some trade. He shows her the golden ring with the lapis lazuli in it, which she says she's interested in. She's not interested in the silver that D4 also offers, but will pay 200 gold for the golden ring.

After the trade is made, D4, Beck and Petr head further into town, eventually finding their way to the watering hole where the others are. They walk in just as Lukani is thanking Galen and Rydia for helping put an end to a potential bar brawl, offering them a free round of drinks in thanks. As she notices the others walk in, Rydia telepathically tells Beck to keep an eye on the elf with the tiger; Beck pretends to not be surprised by the sudden familiar voice he hears in his mind.

They catch each other up, Galen saying that everything here is just fine, looking pointedly at the captain. Lukani then pulls at Galen's sleeve to get his attention, asking him to retrieve a necklace for him. “I hid a necklace for my wife in a massive desert rose, can't miss it in the center of town. Would you do me the favor of laying that to rest on her grave?” Galen agrees, asking where she's buried. Lukani says she's buried in the cemetery in town, they can't miss it.

Petr, noticing the tiger, takes a closer look at it. He can't quite put his finger to it, but there's something strange about the creature. It looks and behaves like an animal, but there's something weird about it. D4 asks Petr what he's looking at, so Petr tells him he was just taking a look at the cat, warning D4 there's something wrong with it. He also advises against putting your finger on it, as it's quite a big cat, which D4 goes to do, despite Petr telling him not to do so.

Moving over towards the tiger, D4 gets warned by the elf. “I'd stand back if I were you, big guy. Mapu is feral.” He explains this means that she's wild and hungry. D4 points out he's pretty sure she won't like eating him. “She'll crack that tin of cat food on the outside and get to the organic insides, if you have any…” D4 points out that sounds gruesome, before asking the elf why he would bring her inside if that's the case. He then tells D4 to go away, saying he's done with his idiotic questions. He eventually just walks off.

D4 moves back over towards the others, telling Beck he's pretty sure that was impolite of the man. “I don't think he was interested in making friends today,” Beck points out, Rydia pointing out she's somewhat impressed by how D4 just ‘casual conversationed' someone out of the room.

Putting two and two together from the captain's injury, what Beck knows of her past and the fact a Valenor elf just exited the bar, Beck wordlessly checks in with the captain, buying her a drink. The elf was clearly getting under her skin for a number of reasons. Beck then asks Rydia, Galen and the captain if they have the information they need; when they confirm this, they soon decide to head out.

After drinks are suggested and Beck declines, Rydia comments on how this isn't the kind of freelance airship crew she was expecting, to which the captain points out they've had a bit of a rough time lately, so it probably is better for them to stay clearheaded on this. After gathering some directions from Lukani, they head out towards Krezent. They're supposed to look out for a small town atop a mesa, near a small creek.

The temperature quickly drops as they climb up towards the more mountainous area. They eventually maneuver the airship between mountains into a valley, where they can see the village sit on this mesa of red rock in the center of this valley. It is immediately eerily quiet; plants and wildlife have overtaken the crumbling houses, birds and other creatures nest in exposed rafters. The overcast sky adds an air of oppression to the scene, seemingly enveloping the village. They can hear a creek a little below as they anchor the ship.

There's various buildings in the small town; a ramshackle blacksmith and stonemason shop, a dreary graveyard to the north west, a strange construction with pulleys and ropes to the east, which seems to be a well of sort. The center of the village is home to a large walled compound, a stone wall surrounding a two story mansion. A narrow passage leads to where they believe the mine to be.

Outside of the wildlife, there don't seem to be any signs of life around. Rydia comments on how eerie the place looks, D4 pointing out it looks like a dead town. They agree to find the necklace that Lukani mentioned first, easily spotting the large desert rose that he mentioned, in the courtyard of the walled compound in the center of the village.

They head there, through the slightly ajar gates, Galen walking up to the desert rose and finding the necklace hidden in there. He pulls it out; a platinum oval pendant, with the words “For Lorna, Forever” inscribed in them. Rydia wonders if this means that the barman owned this mansion, which they're not sure about.

Before heading to the graveyard, they decide to look around the mansion, to see if they can find anything inside that might indicate what happened here. The two large doors that signal the entrance to the house are unlocked, and open easily, though they do make a slight creaking sound. Dust has settled everywhere in the house.

They enter into a wide hallway. There's moth eaten cloaks hanging from hooks, to the left hallways branch of and ahead a stairway leads up to the second floor. The door beneath the stairs seems to lead into a backyard. D4 calls out, Rydia adding that they're just concerned citizens, but there's no response from inside the house.

Sticking together, they look through the house in search for an office of sorts. They first check the two doors to their right, finding a dining room and a parlor of sorts. Though there's a desk in the parlor, it's old and falling apart, with any papers that might've been inside it at some point likely eaten by worms that have been eating through the wood as well.

They walk through the rest of the house then, looking for anything of interest. Most everything is dust covered in this house. There are a couple of rooms that seem to serve like meeting rooms, which have oil paintings inside them. One of these paintings depicts two figures. One is a dark skinned man dressed in a cream colored frock coat. Dark hair, pulled up into a bun. He's next to a woman wearing a similar colored garb, her hair down, she's also dark skinned. Both of them are human and both are wearing delicate jewellery. The man notably has a signet ring on his finger, inscribed with a snowdrop blossom.

Petr knows that it's odd for there to be a snowdrop blossom on the ring, as that flower is hardly native to this area. He knows the flower is more common in cold, mountainous areas, this one specifically might be from the Blackcap Mountains in Breland. It seems these people were flown in to head up this town; they weren't from here originally. Petr shares this information with Beck. They also notice the names on the painting: the man is Mayor Lei Duvezin and the woman is Lorna Duvezin.

Galen shares what was inscribed on the necklace he found, and considering the man in the painting looks nothing like Lukani, they briefly discuss what might've happened there. Rydia points out it seems strange the necklace was hidden in a plant outside this place, suggesting maybe they had an affair. “Maybe she was heartbroken, which caused her to end her own life which cursed the entire town … Or maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic,” Rydia says, saying she's intrigued now.

Outside of the portrait, they also find a library. The shelves are filled with books, a low table in the center of the room. A wide bank of windows in the south provides a view over the nearby area. The other rooms in the house are mainly just sleeping quarters.

Though still covered in dust, the books in the library seem largely untouched. D4 is excited by the sheer prospect of a large number of books, as he can learn a lot from them. They all notice a number of them are laid open on the table, with notes attached, writing scribbled on them. The topics of the laid out books include effects of physical and emotional trauma, nightmares, mysterious disappearances, and, seemingly out of place in comparison; a book about manifest zones. It holds a single note written in a shaky hand: “Could this be the answer?” It seems like someone was looking into what happened here.

Every kid in Eberron gets told about ‘other worlds' that are around Eberron. They are the moons surrounding the planet. In some places, it's possible to travel from the world to one of these moons, but those are dangerous places. These are cautionary tales. A manifest zone therefore is a known thing to most of the group. D4 starts speed reading some of the books as Beck gets sidetracked for a moment, looking for books on Cyre.

He finds one, called ‘The Jewel in Gallifar's Crown; Why Cyre Is The Best Of Us', which he pockets. He also finds a diary, which seems to belong to Lorna. It recounts her life; the last few pages are scribbles. She speaks of her life before Krezent, moving here, falling in love with somebody else. He shares this with the rest as he joins the others again. telling Rydia she got her love story.

Rydia stays outside the room, doesn't seem very enthused by the fact that her theory just got confirmed. Beck takes a look at the books whilst Galen goes through the handwritten notes on the desk. Sharing what they find, they find that the notes suggest that not all the miners were instantly killed by the collapse. Some spent days or weeks in darkness before dying; the notes try to go into what that would do to a person, being alone and trapped like that for so long.

It also notes that the villagers tried to protect themselves by sleeping with weapons and taking shifts in watch, but even after the last miners were recovered and buried, villagers kept disappearing. The books talk about manifest zones; manifest zones to all kinds of strange worlds are known and documented, with one exception. There used to be manifest zones to the land of dreams, Dal'Qor. That connection was severed millenia ago.

Dal'Qor was rumored to be a place of good dreams, but also of nightmares. Whoever was making these notes was finding parallels between the rumors of a manifest zone to Dal'Qor, which technically shouldn't be possible, and what was happening here in Krezent.

As Beck and Galen share this with the others, D4 asks if there's a mushroom land where you dream, which Galen says is sort of what is happening. Rydia then suggests that maybe they should just leave, whereas D4 instead suggests they should look at the mine. Galen then drops the notes, joining Rydia outside the room.

“Are you okay?” Rydia says she is, but books, manifest zones; this is seemingly making her uncomfortable. “I didn't expect this. I expected a fun romp in the mines, maybe some romance, maybe a ghost story…” She's not happy about the similarities between this and something she and Galen encountered before.

Galen points out that it'd look pretty bad if they say they're gonna haul up in the ship and leave the others to deal with it, so they agree to just be careful and keep going.

Having found everything they think they can find here, they decide to head to the graveyard before going to the mine. As they head outside, the sun is starting to set. The graveyard is surrounded by a crooked wrought iron fence and is overgrown by desert shrubs. Some headstones are overgrown, toppled, as well as some cairns, presumably for the halflings, as some of them are topped by dinosaur skulls. The place seems abandoned.

A bit further down the road, they also see a wagon which is lying on its side, abandoned in the middle of the road. D4 heads over towards the wagon, noticing the fading paint which says ‘Mademoiselle Antinua's Wonderland'. He asks Petr if he's familiar with this, but he isn't. They decide to take a look inside as Galen goes to find the gravestone.

He starts walking past all these stones and finds one that reads ‘Lorna Grossvenor, Beloved of Lukani, Forever my Heart'. As he places the necklace on the headstone, he hears what sounds like a contented sigh in the wind, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up.

Over at the wagon, D4 finds a dead and rusted Warforged inside. He's lying on the floor and has been completely rusted over, clearly having been here for a while. At the other side of the wagon, what used to be the roof, there's a large hole, through which all sorts of sand has blown inside the wagon.

Taking a closer look at the Warforged, D4 notices that he seems to have been ripped apart. There's large scratches on his exterior, and one of his hands is clutching his chest. D4 takes away the hand, finding a dull blueish glow coming from inside his chest. Peering inside, D4 can see a strange orb, seemingly made of stone. It has some lingering glowing magic; it's covered in all sorts of runes. The stone is cracked, but D4 still thinks he recognises this as a docent. They're magic items, specifically engineered for Warforged to grant them certain knowledge or abilities.

D4 shows it to Petr, saying he thinks it's a Warforged relic of sorts. Neither of them know what the runes on it say. As Beck approaches his friends inside the wagon, he too spots the name on it and immediately recognises it. This wagon is part of the traveling carnival that his parents and technically he as well are part of, as it's their Changeling tribe.

He starts looking around for any sign of other wagons, but doesn't see any, then heads inside to look around for anything else he might recognise. He finds a disguise kit of sorts, as well as some rotted away instruments, but other than that there's not much in there. Beck knows ‘Mademoiselle Antinua's Wonderland' is the name of the entire carnival, and this is the show name of an elven woman named Velania.

D4 checks in with Beck, who explains that he's familiar with this carnival. He says he grew up there for a while, though it was mostly his parents who were part of it, as he was raised in [[Metrol]]. D4 asks what his parents did as part of the carnival, Beck saying that they were acrobats. They then look at the ball, Beck also recognising it as a docent, though it doesn't seem to be a working model. He also recognises that the language of the runes seems to be Giant.

Galen and Rydia join the others as well, Rydia noticing the docent as well, finding that she can read the runes on it. Some are weathered off, but some of the runes are still readable. One stands for the great Cul'sir, one stands for the crossing of realities / minds / viewpoints. Another stands for captors of the king and the last one she recognises stands for the Elven proverb Somnium Teneberis, which means a dark dream.

She says all this aloud, sharing it with the group, Beck pointing out that sounds somewhat in line with what the books were about. Beck asks what language that was, Beck saying it's Giant, after which Galen asks Rydia since when she's able to read Giant. Rydia says she doesn't, which Galen quickly brushes off and they soon decide to just head towards the mine.

As they head towards the mine, they find themselves in front of a narrow bridge, right in front of a cave of sorts, with a large blue-ish grey scorpion in front of it. As they get closer, the scorpion also moves in closer, yet it seems unable to leave the shadows, seemingly sensitive to the light. Petr also notices more scorpions inside the cave, which he points out to the others.

As they all stop on the other side of the bridge, Rydia suggests that she can try and speak to the scorpion, which she does, but the scorpion doesn't seem to understand language, so she can't communicate with it.

Beck says he wants to try something, asking for a torch, which Rydia gives him. Lighting up the torch, he crosses the bridge, and waves the fire in the direction of the scorpion, trying to see if it moves away from that as well, which it does. He also notices that the scorpion seems to be a hollow exoskeleton, yet it still moves. D4 sends his zoomer ahead as well, lighting that up, but the magical light doesn't seem to have the same kind of effect. It does illuminate the fact that there's a strange purple-ish ooze inside this exoskeleton, the ooze seemingly animating the creature.

The ooze doesn't seem to appreciate both the fire and the zoomer in its face, lashing out at Beck, hitting him with its stinger, which pierces him right in his chest. The ooze residu left on his chest immediately burns away because of the proximity to the fire Beck is still holding. Beck immediately retaliates, swinging at the animated scorpion with the torch in his hand. He manages to jut it into the exoskeleton, the torch getting stuck, but the fire dealing quite some damage.

Galen moves a little closer, pulling out his gun and taking a shot, hitting. The scorpion's face comes apart, revealing more purple ooze as a spray of purple-ish acid shoots out, hitting Beck, Petr as well as the captain. Both Beck and Petr manage to dodge somewhat out of the way, but the captain is hit, leaving both Beck and the captain looking rather hurt. As the creature moves away, Beck takes a swing at it with his rapier, managing to hit it as it moves back.

Moving in closer, D4 puts up his flame cannon, aiming it at the scorpion and encasing it in fire, leaving the creature looking rough as it shrieks out in pain. Rydia looks from Beck to the captain, both of whom look hurt, before sighing and turning pale as her maw appears. She walks forward, sending an eldritch blast at the scorpion, but it goes wide, still hitting the exoskeleton, yet not the ooze inside. Moving right up to it, she then stares it down.

Petr sees the two of them standing face to face, reaching out and casting Moonbeam atop the ooze. The captain shoots at it with her crossbow, which hits, calling out to Rydia to attack it as well, but the creature manages to dodge out of the way of Rydia's bite attack. Staying back, Beck switching from his rapier to his violin as he casts Dissonant Whispers, and it's a final shot from Galen's gun that finishes off the scorpion.

With this ooze invested skeleton dealt with, they carefully take a look inside the cave the scorpion came from, realising that the other exoskeletons Petr saw from outside were just that - skeletons, seemingly all already consumed by the ooze and no longer a threat.

Both Beck and the captain heal themselves a little, D4's zoomer helping Beck a little as well; before they continue their way towards the mine, Rydia leading the way as they soon find the entrance. It's clearly the entrance to the mine, as there's several carts nearby, and a large looming hole leading into the earth. A couple of the carts seem to be full with beams of wood, perhaps for support. Near there, Petr notices some berries, which he knows to be sindaberries, which when properly prepared can help one gain resistance to poisons. He pockets about 23 of these berries, making a mental note to prepare some of these later.

They gather at the entrance of the mine, which looks completely dark from where the daylight can't reach inside. D4 sends his zoomer ahead, using it's light to illuminate the way ahead. The mine seems dark and damp, with an oppressive gloomy and shadowy atmosphere. There's a couple of hallways branching off the main one.

Rydia leads the way inside, the others following behind her. Petr grabs a torch from his backpack and lights it, the zoomer continuing to light the way ahead as well. The main hall splits into two, Rydia leading the way down the shaft that leads to the left. D4 leaves the zoomer near Rydia, who can point out she can see just fine, even without it. Up ahead, to the north, she spots vast amounts of rubble, as well as a single ore cart.

This seems to be one of the collapsed shafts, now having been cleared out as the bodies of the victims have been recovered. The gloom in this hallway is palpable, all of them feeling the hairs of their neck standing up for a moment. D4 sends the zoomer to inspect the ore cart, finding a solid piece of platinum ore, which D4 brings with him.

Down another shaft to the right, they can hear the sound of running water, but they keep heading left instead, Rydia saying she feels more comfortable taking her risk with a hallway that previously collapsed and already got cleared out again as opposed to a bridge that doesn't seem very sturdy. The others agree, so they head into the shaft on the left.

As Rydia starts walking in, partially illuminated by the zoomer, Galen, who is right next to her, sees that the shadows Rydia casts almost seem different from how the real Rydia is moving next to him. Rydia, looking around, notices clear signs of the terror that these people must've gone through. Claw marks in the rock, blood stains everywhere and as they descent deeper into the shaft, she starts to hear fleeting whispers.

She points out the claw marks to the others, running her hand across them. “This was a terrible tragedy,” she says, Beck asking her if she thinks it's specifically this room where this happened. Rydia says she thinks so, so Beck casts Detect Magic. The hair on his arms immediately stands up; everything in this area is radiating a form of conjuration. “There's something magical about this place and I don't know if that's a good thing,” he points out, explaining to the others it's a whole aura to this entire area.

He deduces that this might be the manifest zone. It likely wasn't here before, but was specifically created by the trauma that happened in this area. The shaft spirals further down and they keep following it, eventually ending up in a larger room. This room branches off into other places as well.

The main room has pieces of platinum still shining in the walls; there's another mining cart in the room as well and there's various natural pillars that keep the ceiling overhead supported. Thick velvety black moss covers these pillars. Beck turns to Petr, asking him if he knows if the moss is normal. Even from about 35 feet away, Petr knows these aren't normal, which he shares with the others.

Beck theorizes that perhaps the zone caused the moss somehow as well, which Petr isn't sure about. As he steps further into the room to take a closer look at the moss, Petr sees something move from the corner of his eye. He blinks, and then it's gone again. He moves to approach the moss, but as he gets within 10 feet of it, the moss forms two strange tentacles that lash out at Petr.

He manages to jump out of the way, quickly warning the others of this as well. “The moss tried to grab me, it shouldn't do that, there's weird stuff going on here,” he says, so they all agree to just stay away from the moss. “Also, I thought I saw something move back there.” As he looks around, Petr can see his reflection in one of the puddles of the ground, and he swears he suddenly sees the face of his father instead. He asks Beck to come over as well, take a look in the puddle. Beck does so, but just sees himself in the reflection.

Beck's Detect Magic also picks up on the moss as he gets closer, another conjuration type of magical effect. Petr describes what he just saw in the puddle, Beck asking if he and his dad look alike, but Petr points out he'd definitely still be able to tell the difference.

Rydia moves further into the room as well, calling out, but not getting a response from anyone. As she looks at the general shape of the room, she's pretty sure that these aren't mining tunnels; this room is much larger than those. All of them also notice that all the sound in this room is muffled, likely because of the large amount of black moss.

Moving closer to Rydia, Galen feels the hair on his arms stand on end, telling Rydia and the others that maybe they should get out. They discuss what to do for a moment, Beck saying he's not sure what they're hoping to achieve here. “Either we leave, or we trigger whatever this is and where everyone else is, and then I don't know how we get out.” D4 suggests he could send the zoomer in deeper, as Rydia suggests she can't much worse.

As she looks over at one of the puddles, she suddenly sees the face of Cassandra Everfrost, quickly looking away. Everyone notices her reaction, Galen quickly asking what it is. “I saw something,” she explains when Galen asks what's wrong. Petr walks over as well, asking Rydia if she also saw his dad in the reflection. “Not unless your dad is an elf, and female.” It was apparently not his dad, though the mention of an elf seems to ring a bell for Galen.

Petr seems glad he's not the only seeing things, as Galen starts insisting they leave right now. They briefly discuss whether or not they can claim their bounty if they go now or not, Beck pointing out that they can report back what they found, and Galen pointing out that if they want to get paid, they need to not be dead.

All on the same page about leaving, they start heading back up, safely making their way back to the village and to where they left the airship. Before they go back up to the ship, D4 takes a quick look at the area with the scaffolding, using the pulley system to lower a bucket to try and bring up some water. As he brings it back up, the rope snaps and, with the scaffolding creaking underneath his feet, D4 decides to get out before it might collapse.

They all move back up to the airship then, Beck suggesting that they get out of town, as it wasn't just the mines people were disappearing from. Rydia points out the voices, and the people, but Beck points out that he's not sure if they can help them, even if they do find them. Wanting to try one more time to take a look at what's going on in the mine, they fly the airship over to hover the entrance as D4 sends his zoomer back inside.

It's gone for a while, returning about thirty minutes later, sputtering and clearly damaged. It uses it's projection to show D4 and the others what it saw inside the mines, showing an image of a strange, wispy looking creature that none of them recognise. As they're all looking at this, a strange sound suddenly emanates from D4's chest cavity.

D4 reaches inside, revealing that it's the broken docent that's making the sound. It's glowing bright blue and is chittering, as if it's trying to speak but it's too broken to form proper words. Beck suggests that maybe D4 can fix it and as they set sail to head back towards Gatherhold, he and Beck take a look at the stone device. The captain takes the helm as Beck and D4 withdraw themselves in D4's workshop.

Together, they manage to get it back in working order enough by cleaning the dust and grime between the stones around the surface. The stones start to jump in and out of the orb as sound emanates from it. The sound, now clearer, is a voice speaking in Common: “At night, a creeping darkness will come.”
