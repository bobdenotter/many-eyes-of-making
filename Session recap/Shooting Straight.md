# Shooting Straight

Earlier that day, a gnome by the name of Bonzobur Bertrond Boltsnapper found himself in the city of Gatherhold, looking for a way out. Just as he felt he was running out of options, he spotted an airship hanging over a crevasse and he decided to make his way over. He called up at the warforged aboard the ship, noticing him tinkering on some things and offering tips. The warforged, D4, invited him aboard the ship and together, they set to work fixing some of the acid damage to the ship.

Both of them were so focused on fixing the ship that they didn’t notice two warforged landing on the ship and suddenly, Bonzobur’s lights went out.

When he comes to some time later, finding himself in the engine room, next to a net filled with looks like the remains of D4, as well as his companion Betsy, both of them in parts. He crawls out of the room as he hears footsteps approaching, hiding in the double walls of the ship.

Two warforged walk in the room right after he hides, deep in discussion. “I don’t know what stripping an airship has to do with finding criminals, but I better follow orders.” The other warforged doesn’t seem to agree, asking why they would follow orders and pointing out that they could sneak out and head into the mist, towards Making to join the Lord of Blades.

“Because House Cannith gave me life, and has always been kind to me,” the first warforged responds, to which the other points out that they’re just toy soldiers to these people. “We could make our own gods.” The first warforged seems tired of the other’s talk of revolution. “You heard master Jonah. The becoming gods is a fabrication myth. The only divinity is in blood, which neither you or I possess.”

He then asks the other warforged to take the net back up, which he does and as both of them move away, Bonzo crawls further into the bowls of the Heritage to stay safe. Some more time passes until Bonzo hears a very loud gunshot coming from the back of the ship. Curious, Bonzobur starts moving towards the noise to try and see what’s happening, doing so carefully.

Having just installed the crystal, Beck and Galen head back upstairs. Beck keeps going as Galen hears something in the walls. He goes to investigate as Rydia, on the ground again and face to face with the man in black, moves in closer. Her entire face splits open into a single large mouth and she goes in for the attack, but then stops herself at the last moment, recomposing herself. “I don’t want this. Stop trying to be my food,” she tells the man, standing up and lowering her arms as she tries to keep herself in control.

The man stares at her with wide eyes, throwing up his hands as Rydia remains there, staring him down. Back on the ship, Galen can’t really figure out what it is he heard, so he slowly starts heading up the stairs to join Beck on the deck. Before he gets there, Bonzobur moves out of where he was hiding and starts slowly heading up the stairs as well, the two of them spotting each other.

“Who are you? Is it safe?” Bonzo asks, to which Galen asks what he means, and asks him who he is as well. “I was working here on this ship with this warforged, D4, trying to make repairs,” Bonzo explains. Before he gets to explain more, Galen asks him if he works for House Cannith, which he denies. “I was passing by and the warforged was making repairs, so I figured I’d help him out. We were busy and suddenly it went black and I woke up on the ship.”

As he says he’s trying to get out of Gatherhold, Galen simply says that’s great and confirms they’re leaving before he starts heading up the stairs, Bonzo following him up to the deck.

Beck, up on the deck, easily spots the captain, Petr and Rydia are now back on the ground. Trusting Petr will get the captain back up, he heads to the helm, turning the ship as he calls out to Galen. “They’re down on the ground again, can you lower the ladder?”

Down on the ground, Petr lands beside the captain, questioning his choice to jump down for a moment before he leans down, touching the captain on the shoulder and casting Cure Wounds. He helps her back up to her feet and the two of them start heading towards the ship, where soon after Galen starts lowering the ladder so they can climb back up to the ship.

As Petr and the captain move closer, they spot the Karnathi people, along with Lady Dahlia, moving back towards the ship, seemingly confused by what’s going on and by the shots they heard. Not far from there, Rydia starts walking away from the man in black, turning around before making a running jump at the ship, latching on to the side of the ship before it moves too far away.

After the ladder is lowered, Petr and the captain grab hold of it and Beck continues navigating the ship away. Lady Dahlia aids in their escape by shooting a spell at the man in black and through using Thaumaturgy shouts out after Galen: “Lady Ophelia said hi”. Before she releases her spell, Galen sees the image of Dahlia shimmer, revealing a very old, pale-skinned figure. She cuts herself, as the blood that releases forms into a red tendril in her hand that hits the man in black.

The ship continues moving away, out of town as Petr, the captain as well as Rydia climb their way back onto the deck of the ship. Petr escorts the captain - who seems utterly exhausted and broken - to her cabin, as Beck, Galen and Bonzo are gathered around the net that holds D4’s remains, as well some other parts that Bonzo seems to recognise. “Oh no, Betsy, no,” he says as Galen turns to Beck, telling him that they seem to have a visitor.

As the others join the three of them as well, Bonzo asks what happened, a question that Galen directs at Beck. When Beck asks why he’s being asked this, Galen points out he seemed to know Jonah, to which Beck outs out that Galen seemed to know the Karnathi lady. “I did know Jonah, but I haven’t seen him in years. Still didn’t really expect him to go after any of us, or the captain so hard,” Beck says.

“Or D4,” Galen adds, and they take a look at D4, trying to deduce whether or not they’re something they can still do for him. Bonzo, who’s cradling what looks like a mechanical alpaca head, explains that this is Betsy, to which Beck points out that what else is in that net is their friend, D4. Bonzo says he knows, as he worked with D4 for a little while before they got jumped.

He explains a little more of what happened, before asking where they are headed and what just happened. “The short version is a deal went wrong, not because of anything we did, and now someone’s pissed off at us and apparently wants us dead,” Beck explains, which Bonzo says sounds somewhat familiar. “Does that happen to you often?” Galen asks him, to which Bonzo says yes, it seems to happen every once in a while.

“So, what’s your name?” Beck then asks their new guest, who introduces himself as Bonzobur Bertrond Boltsnapper, saying he used to be a traveling merchant, selling various knick-knacks and stuff as he worked as a mechanic as well. “I think I offered my services to the wrong people; I don’t intend to see them anymore, hopefully.” The others introduce themselves as well. “I guess you’re stuck with us for a while, because we’re airborne and we’re getting out of here,” Petr offers, though Bonzo doesn’t seem to have a problem with that.

Rydia stays a little off to the side, listening to the conversation but not saying much. Beck then asks Bonzo if he has any experience working on warforged, who says it’s been a while, but he did serve in the military so he might be able to help. Bonzo takes a look, concluding that fixing D4 might just be beyond his own skillset, but he does share that he knows there’s House Cannith creation forges where they might be able to fix D4 still.

“Right, that shouldn’t be a problem,” Beck comments with a sigh, as Galen comments that he could use a drink. They all agree they could use some rest, Beck briefly bringing up where they might want to go next before they eventually decide to head towards a remote place in the plains where they might be able to rest up. They figure they can set out a proper course after they’ve rested up a little.

Galen and Rydia head downstairs to try and figure out dinner as Beck, Petr and Bonzo remain on the deck. Petr pulls Beck aside, pointing out that he’s still hoping to go to his meeting with these Gatekeepers. He says he has five days to get there, so going to Q’barra first wouldn’t work. Though Petr tries to keep this conversation private, Bonzobur overhears the conversation and walks over.

Putting a couple of things together, he realises that a relatively close port with lightning rail access is Korranberg. “Might I suggest that we perhaps take a detour to Korranberg?” Bonzo suggests. “I might be able to help out there with the ship as well.” Beck also knows there’s a famous library in Korranberg as well, which he thinks might peak Galen’s interest, if they need another way to sell this idea to him and Rydia.

“I think if we tell them we have to go to Korranberg, tell them we have to better arm the ship, that might work,” Petr concludes, before suggesting they go have dinner so they can bring this up as casually as possible. “If it becomes a group consensus, that’s the best way to go.”

Downstairs, Rydia and Galen are busy making dinner. In a roundabout way, Galen asks Rydia if she’s okay, which she says she is. “Things seem worse,” Rydia comments, “things seem worse since we tried to leave. Not … this,” and she gestures at herself. “Well, this, but also, we’re getting shot, a lot. Everyone tries to kill us. Except, them. And now one of them is … broken. Two are broken.”

“What’re you saying?” Galen asks, but Rydia doesn’t seem to be sure what she’s saying. “I think we got ourselves in this shit a long time ago,” Galen comments, as Rydia gives him some cooking instructions before confirming that she thinks that they should trust the airship crew. “We should trust someone. It can’t be just us.” Galen promises he’ll talk to them and, knowing Rydia would rather not be there for that conversation, adds that there’s some things he wants her to be there for as well. He promises he’ll leave all of the things she doesn’t want to be there for, til after Rydia leaves.

They eventually finish up dinner and after they drop the anchor near a cavern in the plains where they think they’re safe, the others join Rydia and Galen downstairs for dinner. Bonzo gets his first proper look at Rydia as he walks downstairs and as she still has the white hair and the extra eyes, he asks what’s wrong with her. Trying to excuse herself and walk out, Rydia is stopped by Galen.

“You, sit down and eat your dinner and be fucking thankful, or leave,” Galen says to Bonzo, who does so, sitting down at the table and starting to eat slowly. Petr sits down next to him, commenting on how awkward this is. The food is wonderful though, and Bonzo compliments Rydia on the food, as do the others.

As Bonzo comments on how long of a day it’s been, Galen cuts to the chase, asking who wants to go first. “What is this, a round of sharing past traumas, or…?” Beck asks, before Galen brings up Jonah again, curious if Beck knows what that’s about. Beck shares what he knows about Jonah. “I know he’s part of House Cannith, I know my parents worked for his family and I know I grew up with Jonah and that he was my best friend. Right up until about two and a half years ago, when I told him something he didn’t appreciate.”

He also touches upon when he and the captain were held hostage, it was because they attended a negotiation during which Beck was pretending to be Jonah. “We were captured by Karnathi soldiers, which is a lot more interesting considering recent developments.” Galen asks about what the charges were, Beck simply pointing out it was war, and that they eventually got out simply because the war ended. “That’s all I know,” Beck concludes, though he adds that he’s not sure why what he told Jonah back then would have to do with the captain, as she wasn’t involved with that.

“What about you? You seemed to know that lady. You must’ve told her something impressive to convince her to let us leave,” Beck then points out, after which Galen shares some more of what he knows about that. He explains he’s been working as a freelancer lately, but that wasn’t always the case. “Many years ago I was doing some work for someone in Karrnath; Lady Ophelia. It was mostly a research gig, I was helping her look into some things. I left and I haven’t seen her since.”

He says that despite having left, he knows enough about Lady Dahlia and about the organization she works for. “I managed to convince her I was still working for Lady Ophelia, and she let us go.” Beck points out she did more than that; she helped them get away. “I’m not backstabbing anyone; I’m not working for Karrnath anymore.”

Beck points out that, considering he and the captain used to work for House Cannith, that might just put them on equal ground. “There’s a group that tends to use this symbol,” Galen goes on, pulling out his gold skull pocket watch to show the others. “That’s who I can try and get some pull with, but it’s risky. To be honest, I’m surprised Dahlia even helped us; I did not leave on the best of terms.”

Changing the subject, Galen comments on how going back for the captain was brave, both Petr and Beck pointing out they’ve known her for a long time, and they weren’t going to leave her behind. “We might’ve lost D4, but we’re sticking with the captain. That’s a given,” Petr adds.

Trying to figure out where they want to go next, Beck mentions that Petr needs to go somewhere, and Rydia and Galen want to go to Q’barra, so they could figure something out. When Galen asks where Petr needs to go, Petr simply says it’s almost his mom’s birthday. Petr then shares what Bonzo shared earlier, suggesting that they can go to Korranberg. There’s a chance to fix up the ship some more there, and there’s also the lightning rail which provides them with easy access to places.

Both Galen and Bonzobur know that laying low in Korranberg or Zilago as a whole might be hard, as it’s one of the most socially controlled nations in the world. That being said, it shouldn’t necessarily be a problem, as long as they don’t do anything illegal. They also know that both House Sivis and House Cannith have big estates in the town, though this is a different branch of the Cannith family, which is at odds with the part of the family that Jonah seems to belong to.

Galen comments as much, adding that despite that he wouldn’t mind going to the library. Bonzo adds that he used to study at the library, Galen admitting that he did too, though the two of them don’t seem to have crossed paths before.

They all agree that Korranberg might not be a bad idea right as the captain shows up. She introduces herself to Bonzo, who she hasn’t met yet. “My name is Fianin, I’m the captain of this vessel.” Bonzo introduces himself in turn, offering he’s a mechanic. She then says she just came to grab some food, offering that she thinks all of them deserve a little R&R for a bit.

When Beck asks her how she’s feeling, she says she’s not feeling great. “It was tough getting shot at by a friend, getting knocked unconscious a couple of times by that … fucking guy, jumping off of the airship without any protection for some reason and … seeing D4 in parts, it’s …” She apologises, clearly having had a rough time. “If we go to Korranberg, I might sneak out for a bit and go to the city of Passage via the lightning rail to meet with an old friend.” Everyone is quick to agree this is of course fine; Petr promising they’ll take care of the ship in the meantime.

“Thank you all for saving my life, by the way,” she says before walking out, Beck pointing out she saved their lives plenty of times too. Galen then turns to Rydia, asking her if she still wants him to talk to the group. She confirms this, before walking out the room with her plate.

Galen then turns to the others. “There’s something else we need to talk about,” he starts. The others quickly deduce this might be about what happened to Rydia, Petr pointing out that they didn’t ask because they expected Rydia to react badly. “I’m gonna start at the beginning,” Galen then says. “I met Rydia about a year ago in Fairhaven, it was at an inn. We got along. I was freelancing at the time, so we left and I guess you could say we went treasure hunting. Most of the stuff we found we fenced.”

“Eventually, we went after this book in Karrnath. We found it, I got sloppy and she saved me. All I know is that the day that happened, I blacked out and when I woke up, she was like that. That was three months ago.” He pauses for a moment. “I got us out of there. She was in a coma for that entire time, looking like that. And a couple of days before we met you, she walked downstairs looking like Rydia again.”

He points out they were normal people until they found that book, to which Beck points out that they’ve seen things shooting out of Galen’s stomach. He says he doesn’t know about that, pointing out he got the better end of the deal there because he doesn’t have a giant maw on his neck.

Beck asks where the book is now, to which Galen says he doesn’t know. “So … what’s in Q’barra?” Beck then asks. Galen explains that, whilst in her coma, Rydia kept saying the same phrase over and over again. One of Orryn’s guys said what she said might have something to do with Q’barra. “I wanna go there because I want to figure out what the hell is wrong with her.”

He says he hasn’t been able to research anything, they’ve been running this entire time. He adds he would appreciate the chance to look into this, though he’s not sure how many books there’ll be about what happened to Rydia. “Gotta start somewhere, right?” Beck points out, figuring the library in Korranberg might be a good starting point.

“There’s also that crystal, that was in the letter and that guy in the valley mentioned … I think she’s seen it,” Galen adds, after which Beck recalls that Rydia said she saw it in her mind. Galen concludes that all he knows is that the only lead he has is in Q’barra, so that’s where he wants to go. “I haven’t told anyone any of this, but the way I see it we’re getting shot at together now and I don’t think Jonah’s gonna lift his hands off just because …” He adds that Rydia asked him to trust them, and he does. He then turns to Bonzo. “And you, are now dragged down all this with us, so I hope you don’t mind.” Bonzo simply says he’s happy to get out of Gatherhold.

“Well, looks like we’re all in the same boat. Or airship, if you will,” Beck concludes. “So Korranberg, and then Q’barra.” Bonzobur adds that he might still know some people at the library as well, who might be able to help them figure out what’s happening with Rydia. Galen points out that, whilst he’d appreciate the help, he’d like to not draw too much attention to all this. “I’d appreciate the help trying to figure out what’s going on with Rydia, but I don’t want anyone else on that trail.”

They discuss Rydia some more, Galen expressing he’s just grateful to be able to have a conversation with her again, as he was fairly convinced that he’d lost her. The dinner progresses after this, talks shifting to slightly less serious topics of conversation.

Rydia, out on deck, watches as the sun goes under, the cloudy skill filling with oranges and pinks. She quietly eats from her plate, noticing the captain behind her at some point. “I know how you feel,” Fianin comments, before retreating into her cabin. As it becomes time to retreat for the night, Rydia tells the others that she can keep watch the entire night, casually commenting that she no longer has to sleep.

Petr offers her something that’ll help her stay awake, just in case, but she says she’s pretty sure she’s not going to need it. She keeps watch the entire night as everyone else goes to sleep. The only thing Rydia notices is faces in the mists of the Mournland, which makes her think of her former friends. This sends a shudder down her spine and she pointedly focuses on her plate of food again.

It’s a quiet and well-deserved night’s rest for everyone, except for Galen, who has a dream.

Opening his eyes, Galen finds himself naked and bound against cold stone, candles flickering around him. A thick haze of incense covers the dark room, but through the fog there are three red leather chairs visible in the corner. There are people sat in each, with grey skin and empty sockets for eyes. Looking closer, he recognises one of the figures as Mortem Pent. “Lady Vidante, I respect you, your research and what you are trying to do... but-” he says, before being cut off by one of the other people present. “But what, Mister Pent? Are my ways too peculiar for the Senechal?” Lady Vidante asks sharply, Mortem Pent beginning to explain. “Well, it goes against the ways of Aerenal... I'm not quite sure…”

“Aerenals' ways are the past. Besides, we have tried the ancient rituals to the letter. We need something new,” Lady Vidante offers, Mortem asking his own questions in turn. “And the council? How do they feel about this?” Standing up from his chair, Mortem gets to his feet as a third person walks by. She's pale with long white hair and purple lips, two fangs peeking out from under her upper lip. “You let me worry about the Council,” she says. “Our presenting this idea to you three is merely a formality, Mister Pent. We have every right to bypass the Senechal, but believe it is better to prevent a pointless conflict.”

“Of course, you are right Mistress Karlach... Well, he is an impressive specimen,” Mortem responds, before moving over towards Galen. “Will the fact that he is of your blood not cloud your judgement, Lady Vidante?”

“Are you questioning my loyalty to our Queen, Mortem?” Lady Vidante asks, Mortem quickly telling her he wasn’t, however Lady Vidante explains further. “Yes, it is true he is of my blood. But that is exactly why he is the absolute right specimen. Remember, we need him to stay alive through all of this. Do you think I would sacrifice that on a whim?”

“No, no, that's not what I was saying-”

“Good. Then let's begin.”

Lady Vidante moves towards Galen, tightly strapping a belt around each of Galen's biceps. She then flicks the muscle a couple of times, revealing thick blue arteries. “His eyes are open, my lady,” Mortem notes, but Lady Vidante assures him that Galen isn't conscious. “Very well, proceed. You have the Senechal's blessing,” Mortem tells her, before Galen wakes up.

The following morning, Rydia makes breakfast and everyone else slowly wakes up too. They set course for Korranberg, knowing it’ll take them about three days to get there. The first day of travel goes well, favorable winds cut down travel time, meaning that by the end of the day, they’re only a day away from Korranberg. During the day, Bonzo takes some time to look over what’s left of Betsy, managing to largely put her back together, though she’s not quite functional yet.

Beck makes sure to check in on the captain during the day and also takes some time to look over D4’s parts, trying to fix whatever smaller damages he can find by using the Mending spell. Sometime into the day, Rydia finally manages to get control of her transformed self, her hair no longer white. As soon as this happens, she seeks out Galen, who’s spent most of the day holed up in his cabin, pouring over notebooks. She distracts him from his research for a while. At the end of the day, they already find themselves over Kraken Bay, well on their way towards their destination.

The following day, they continue on their way, traveling along the coast. Things are going quite well, until Petr, who’s piloting the ship, starts hearing odd vibrations going through the ship. He can feel the wood trembling, even hears something snapping, but it’s nothing that immediately concerns him. He does begin to wonder what that is, which is when he spots a large winged creature with a massive beak and a long, spiked tail approaching the ship.

It’s moving fast, so Petr reaches out and rings the alarm bell, drawing everyone’s attention to this, so they all gather on the deck of the ship as Petr points out the creature that’s coming towards the ship. It seems aggressive, and it’s not long before combat ensues. During the fight, the creature screeches, the sound waves shattering the wood of the deck and hitting Petr, Beck, Galen and Rydia, leaving most of them pretty badly hurt and the deck badly damaged. Though none of the others can really see this, Galen is actually knocked unconscious before the pocket watch activates, bringing him back up.

Eventually, they manage to fight off the creature, Galen getting the final shot, hitting the creature in its wing and sending it crashing into the top of the captain’s cabin. Though the danger’s dealt with, they all soon realise that this creature is heavy and it’s weighing down the entire ship. Thinking fast, Bonzo uses his Catapult spell to try and shove the creature off the roof of the captain’s cabin, Beck using his Featherfall spell to catch the creature before it falls onto the deck, managing to make it float overboard without it damaging any more of the ship.

Though there’s a large crack in the soarwood of the ship’s deck, they figure out that it’s likely safe to keep going, so they continue on towards Korranberg, eventually spotting the city in the distance. Under a twilighting sun, they see the very clean, gleaming city on an island, surrounded by defense works and in the middle of a large raging river. There’s a number of large marble buildings and, as they get closer, a couple of gnomes riding griffons come to greet the group.

Before the gnomes reach the ship, Beck switches to Lux and as the gnomes fly up beside the ship, they tell the crew to move to docking bay 5.
