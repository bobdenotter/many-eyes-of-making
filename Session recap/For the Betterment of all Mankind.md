# For the Betterment of all Mankind
Before going to bed that night, Beck takes some time to think on everything they’ve found that day, before deciding to revert to his blank Changeling self, hoping to get a night’s rest without too much overthinking. Rydia stays up as per usual, keeping an eye out, summoning herself some company to join the sheer amount of extra eyes lurking in the shadows on the ship. 

Early in the morning, there’s a knock on the hangar door. As the only one awake, Rydia heads over and answers, finding herself faced with a darker skinned halfling. The halfling introduces herself as Undercaptain Reveria of the Sharn Watch, asking to have a word with Rydia and the rest of the crew. 

Rydia lets her in, asking her to wait in the galley after offering some coffee and goes to wake the others. She finds Beck in his changeling form, but doesn’t comment on it too much, instead leaving to wake the others as Beck switches back to Beck and joins Reveria in the galley. 

Once they’re all gathered, Reveria having professionally introduced herself to everyone who walked in, she informs them that they’ve been made aware of a number of people who seem to be lurking around Lyrander tower, seemingly trying to find their way inside. She asks the group if anyone might be looking for them, and the group tells her about the Blood of Vol, as well as the fact that House Thuranni agents were following them at some point, and the fact that they had run ins with the Daask. 

They’re given a description of the three figures the Sharn Watch has taken note of so far: one has in a man with mutton chops, one is a gaunt halfling man, and one is a woman with a large mop of red hair. The crew says they’ll keep an eye out as Reveria says they’ll continue the Sharn Watch investigation, thanking the crew for the information they shared. 

After she takes her leave, Rydia suggests she can ask Jonah if he still has people following them and when she does, Jonah claims he doesn’t know anything about that. Beck suggests he could ask his mom, as she works for House Thuranni, but they decide against that for now. 

Galen brings up what they’ve found yesterday, voicing his concern for Rydia. If there really is some sort of hole or portal to Xoriat, he doesn’t know what’s going to happen - the slightest of exposure to that plane already proved disastrous. As none of the crew really know what to do to make sure that they’ll be safe, they simply agree they’ll be cautious. 

Bonzo sets to work putting up some alarm spells around the ship as Beck turns to Petr, asking him if he was told what to do about manifest zones by his friends. Petr says he’s not sure, he was simply told to report back if he did find one. 

After Bonzo finishes with setting up the alarms, the group leaves for the Order, keeping an eye out for these people who are supposedly following them once they get outside. Beck has since reverted back to a simple mask of a blonde woman, still not wanting to be himself. As they move across town, they do spot a redheaded woman, seemingly having some breakfast nearby, but they decide against engaging with her, Galen rightfully pointing out they shouldn’t start harassing every single redhead they come across from now on. Beck suggests they keep an eye out the following few days; if they see that specific woman again, they can approach her. 

They get to the Order, where Lina shares that Novac has made some interesting discoveries. He hasn’t gotten a lot of sleep, having spent most of his night going through the books they found. He points out to the group that the binders seem to contain logged dreams. The names listed there, Surasek, Torakhun, Tureya and Xushila, are completely foreign and utterly strange, Novac suggesting these people are not from here. 

He also says that the dreams described are very wild and he thinks there might be lucid dreaming. All of them are focused on a large crystal palace, and there’s some details in the notes about recreating the palace from memory. 

This leads to a discussion on the ritual with the crystal, Galen suggesting that perhaps the ritual did work, but something simply went wrong after it did. This crystal palace might relate to it, though none of them are really sure how and a crystal palace by itself doesn’t really mean anything to any of the group. 

The discussion then turns to where they’ll be going, Beck asking Lina if she and the others have made any decisions on where to go next. She says that Novac is very interested in the people turned to glass, but they’ve decided that Making is the priority. She also admits she’s been very fascinated with the crystal since the group showed it to her, admitting she’s been reading up on it, as well as on Arag. Galen warns her how dangerous these crystals can be, to which Lina says that she knows what she’s doing.

They gather around the teleportation circle and soon find themselves back in Making, at the top of the tower. The second they arrive there’s a loud booming sound, following by gunfire. As they look down out the window, they can see some warforged, firing guns at something they can’t quite make out. They also note that the warforged are now looking up, seemingly having noticed the flash from the teleportation circle as the group arrived. 

The crew notes this, but they all decide to keep going, knowing the entrance to Clawrift is below this very building. They descend the stairs, past the rooms they came through the previous day, with Petr taking the lead and sneaking a little ahead of the group.

Once they’ve descended for a while, they come to a hallway, with a cave in at the end of it. There’s a door near it, and right to the left of the stairs there’s another, larger vault door. Petr also notes a white vat of sorts, with red light coming from the lid, that seems closed. 

The further down they’ve gone, the colder it’s gotten, and the floor here is icy. Petr also notes there’s something stuck in the door that leads to the vault, though whether that was a failed attempt to break in or an attempt to keep people out, he’s not sure.

Investigating the area, he sees some bodies underneath the rubble of the cave in, most of them wearing lab coats. He opens the door to the right of the cave in and finds six more shapes similar to the vat outside. They’re egg-shaped protrusions, surrounded by metal, with strange red rings similar to the vat outside. These however, look like they’ve been smashed, broken. Petr notes that these egg-shaped vats remind him of the egg-shaped building they saw outside. 

There’s a singular rod of metal as well, running from the floor to the ceiling and as he moves further into this room, Petr notices the paste on his hand lighting up, indicating they’re near a manifest zone. 

As he turns around to tell the others what he’s found, he’s suddenly struck from behind by some sort of lightning, soon finding himself engulfed by a strange amorphous lightning creature. He yells out in pain and the others rush in to help, their combined efforts dispatching of the lightning creature with relative ease. 

That’s when Rydia starts hearing whispered voices all around her, one voice clearer than the others. “There they are again. At least one of them has psionic abilities, one arcane caster. Bring them to me. Get rid of the rest.” 

She barely gets to warn the others before a figure slides out from underneath the vault door. It looks human, wearing red robes and as it moves into the room, it cracks the vat that’s still intact and tells whatever’s inside to guard the door. It then turns to Novac, attacking him as a slimy creature with too many eyes starts slithering out of the vat.
 
This is a much tougher fight, Beck getting targeted by the creature and becoming somewhat of a jittery mess as Lina is hit hard by the figure, injected with some sort of device that drains her spinal fluid. The combined efforts of the group kill the larger creature and Rydia gets the final blow on the robed figure, who tries to make an escape but fails, stopped by Rydia biting his head clean off. 

Taking a moment, Galen looks at the device, finding nothing magical about it and deducing it indeed seems to be spinal fluid that was taken from Lina. Though it’s not magical, it does look completely alien to him. Rydia now shares what she heard from the whispers before before speaking out to the room, hoping to reach the voice from before. She does, and the voice calls her feisty, something she has an opinion on. 

There’s a brief discussion on whether or not they should keep going, during which Bonzo heals Lina somewhat and takes a look at Beck, who is still stumbling over his words, eventually using Greater Restoration to fix him. 

With everyone feeling somewhat better, they agree to keep going, moving into the vault and further down. It’s even colder here and they pass by a room where there’s a voice, seemingly stuck in a loop, as well as some projections on a wall that they don’t bother to take a closer look at yet. 

There’s a statue in that same hallway of an old man, with long robes and a cane and a balding head, with just a tuft of hair left. None of the group recognise him. As they keep going, they pass by a mural on the wall, of sprawling weedfields with in the centre, in the distance, a city. As they get closer, they recognise the city as making, though there’s something strange - there’s a large, crystal palace in the center of it. Above the mural there’s a text that reads “For the Betterment of All Mankind”. 

The opposite wall is covered by curtains and the walls behind it are bare. Near these curtains, Beck spots a backpack and he looks through it, finding a potion of healing, a potion of invisibility and 25 platinum. He hands the healing potion to Galen and keeps the rest on himself for now. 

They descend down another staircase and find themselves in a large cavern filled with book cases. Rydia comments on how Galen will like it here, Beck adding that Novac probably will too. Most of the book cases seem to be filled with thin, leatherbound journals and there’s a smell of ozone and sweat in the air. 

In the back of the room, moving from left to right, the group hears some footsteps. They spot five figures; one dressed similarly to the figure they met before, one in blue robes and three in white robes. 

Rydia approaches them, catching their attention by regurgitating the head she bit off earlier, pulling it from her maw and throwing it at the five people. This scares two of the figure clad in white off, making them move away, and catches the attention of the others. 

With their attention caught, Beck approaches, addressing the group and telling them that they would like to speak to their leader. The response he gets is telepathic, the woman in red robes responding by saying she can arrange that, but warning there might be consequences for what the group did to her brother. Beck points out they acted in self defense. 

He’s then told that their leader will see them, but they’re only allowed to come in if they agree to be blindfolded. As this conversation is happening telepathically, Beck shares this with the others. 

The woman in the red robes comments on Rydia and her abilities then, saying they’re quite impressive. She goes on to say that not everyone here is of the same mind, which is something Rydia doubts, but she can’t quite read the woman’s face. 

The woman then introduces herself as Gilaali. She asks the group why they’re here, Beck responding by saying they’re here to figure out what caused the Mourning. “We caused the Mourning,” Gilaali responds, saying it was an unfortunate side effect of the greatest technological invention of the century. She also repeats something that Eltaar said to the group yesterday; the deaths of all these people are only temporary. 

She explains further, saying the reason they were here is to repair something - the link to Dal’Quor. “Our people have always been in close contact with the Il Lashtavar. We all share a mind when we want to, it’s magical.” She adds that, despite that, there’s still room for individuals as well. 

“We have a problem,” she adds, saying that they’re trying to keep their architect from dying. Beck asks if Yonhanna is their architect, which Gilaali confirms, saying that the Mournland’s effects on the human body have proven unpredictable. 

After this brief conversation, the group agrees to be blindfolded so they can speak to Yonhanna. Galen makes sure to pay close attention to what direction they’re going and how many steps they’re taking, hoping he’ll be able to find the way back, whereas Rydia focuses for a moment, making another eye appear on her shoulder, allowing her to see where they’re going. 

She watches as they’re led through a neat, tiled room, with various more vats. Two of them are empty, one of them contains a person; a woman in her mid sixties, naked and floating in this fluid. 

A door opens and they’re met with the howling of wind. Rydia can see Petr’s hand turning bright blue and Beck winces as his dragonmark burns, feels like it’s crawling up his skin. They’re led across a walkway that seems to cross a large rift below, a maelstrom of blues and purples that is clearly a manifest zone of sorts. 

They cross without problem though, and are led through another tiled room as a mist is sprayed over the entire group of people. Through a long hallway, heading further down, they eventually emerge into another room and are all put into a line. 

As their blindfolds are removed, the group looks upon what they know to be Yonhanna d’Cannith. She’s a woman wearing Cannith robes, looking to be in her sixties, her grey hair tied up in a bun. Yet the most notable thing about her is that she’s covered in what look to be cancerous sores.
