# Soaking Sabotage

  



  

Galen speaks to Lumiz, quickly bringing up that he’s the son of the owner of Altaner Artefacts and that he’s here to ask about why business between them has been put on hold. Lumiz explains that she and hers believe that Alterar Artefacts was somehow involved in a robbery.

  

She at first seems hesitant to share more, but Galen convinces her to elaborate that what was stolen was a book. Specifically, a book written by an Aundarian wizard, who was hired by House Cannith to work on something very big.

  

Whoever stole the book used an antimagic device, which Lumiz and House Tharashk believe was obtained through Alternar Artefacts. They know this item wasn’t paid for, making them believe that Altenar Artefacts or whoever was working there at the time is working with those who stole the book.

  

As it starts to rain, Lumiz does explain that they’re essentially still looking into this: if their investigation yields no evidence that Altaner Artefacts was involved, they’re happy to resume business.

  

Meanwhile, still outside this room, Rydia has a view of another hallway with a number of doors. One of the doors just outside of her view opens, and she overhears a female voice saying “I don’t think they have a bow, I think you should use something more clear, rudimentary.” Rydia moves slightly closer to take a better look, managing to do so stealthily. She sees that the voice belongs to a redheaded halfling, wearing a red cloak, belt and knee high boots.

  

The halfling has her hands on her temple and is seemingly speaking to no one, suggesting to Rydia she’s magically messaging someone. Casting Detect Thoughts, Rydia senses exhiliration as well as nervousness coming from the halfling as she continues: “I know it started raining, you’ll just have to do your best.”

  

Back inside the room with Lumiz, the others watch as she gets up from the pool, Galen then noticing a shadow-y figure from above. He reacts quickly when he realises the shadow tries to shoot something at Lumiz, managing to push her out of the way of what looks like a dart.

  

As Beck, Petr and Bonzo chase this figure outside, Galen helps Lumiz up from where he pushed her over to get her out of the way before calling out to Rydia, telling her to get up on the roof to hopefully help intercept whoever just tried to attack Lumiz.

  

Rydia starts climbing up, spotting the redhead halfling she noticed before, who seems startled by Rydia and calls out for the guards.

  

Outside on another walkway, Beck and Bonzo spot an orc, who Beck manages to viciously mock before the orc disappears, seemingly teleporting away. As guards come running from all directions, Rydia climbs up on the roof, initially managing to keep track of the orc as he seems almost invisible under a tree, but the orc eventually manages to get away.

  

As Galen suggests to Lumiz they head somewhere a little safer, Beck calls out to the guards, pointing out the orc to them, also successfully managing to convince them that he and the others aren’t the threat here.

  

They then all meet up in the dressing room where Lumiz, now in a bathrobe, tells her guards to look for this orc. With the guards now on the search, Rydia having told them of how she saw the orc head towards the jungle, Lumiz leads the group to another room in the house, where they’re giving something to drink: a drink called Tej. The entire compound is on lockdown because of what just happened, so they’re not allowed to leave.

  

Rydia realises that she saw the orc carrying a bow, linking the orc to what she heard the halfling say. She asks Lumiz about the halfling, thinking perhaps the halfling is a servant, but Lumiz says that’s not the case. She does know that another member of House Tharashk; Khalar Velderan d'Tharashk, was meeting with a halfling, so she calls out to one of the servants and asks them to get Khalar to join them.

  

As they wait, Galen asks Petr to take a closer look at the poison dart. He realises it’s coated with something called oil of Taggit, a poison that acts upon contact with the skin and both knocks you out and poisons you. He also knows it’s used to make you appear dead when you really aren’t.

  

They speak to Lumiz, trying to figure out who would want to attack her, but she turns the question around on them. Beck turns to Grekk, who’s since joined them as well, confirming that the other Daask member who kidnapped him was an orc, leading them to think that maybe this attack was aimed more at them somehow.

  

The mention of the Daask makes Bonzo uncomfortable, as he shares with the group that those are the people he was running away from in Gatherhold. Beck assures him that the rest of them aren’t really on good standing with the Daask either, so it’s likely they’re all targets when it comes to that.

  

As they’re talking about this orc, Galen realises that he’s familiar with the name of the orc: Crowhunter. He’s heard stories of an orc known for hunting Brelands secret police force: the Dark Lanterns; they were known for wearing all black and they’re therefore nicknamed crows. He particularly recalls a story of how Crowhunter would hide in a bush, the thorns of said bush digging into his skin, and waiting there for a long time as he staked out a target. Once said target went to sleep, he waited for the sound of a snore and hit him through the tent from a distance, killing said target.

  

Meanwhile, Beck is thinking back to what Lumiz said about the book, recalling Jonah having mentioned a wizard by the name of Erix Thiel, in relation to this book. He doesn’t know much else. As he’s wondering about this, Bonzo asks about the poison, wondering if the orc could’ve gotten that somewhere around here. Petr knows that he would’ve been able to get to it almost anywhere in Khorvaire, but he also would’ve passed through the mountains where the plant grows that’s needed to make the poison.

  

Rydia mentions the bow and the halfling again, and right as she brings this up, another half-orc enters the room, introducing himself as Khalar Velderan d’Tharashk. He’s well dressed and as he walks in, Lumiz is quick to ask him about the halfling. Khalar explains that he knows her as Irae and that she came to talk to him because she needed some mounts. He’s familiar with her, having done business with her before.

  

Reaching up, Rydia pulls the memory of what she saw from her mind, holding it out to Khalar, showing him what she saw. Convinced and wanting to help, he offers to cast Locate Creature, sitting down to do so. His dragonmark glows as he casts the spell, but unfortunately he tells the group that he’s unable to locate Irae. This means she’s either out of his range, or she changed her appearance to hide from him.

  

When asked, he shares some more about Irae. He knows she’s part of an adventuring party called the Feeders of Crows, and that there’s four of them; or at least, she asked for four mounts.

  

Lumiz then speaks up, telling Khalar that they should reinstate their business with Altaner Artefacts, considering the fact that Galen saved her life. Khalar agrees to do so, Galen offering to help ease whatever kind of business they’ll get into again. This prompts Khalar to mention the book that was stolen, Beck then mentioning the name Erix Thiel, saying he’s somewhat familiar.

  

Khalar explains a little more, sharing that Erix Thiel was tasked to work on something in the city of Making, and that he fled to Q’barra before the Mourning, horrified by what they were building. Later, he was murdered on the streets of Newthrone. Khalar thinks it was House Cannith who was behind this. Erix was working on something called the Eye of Making. In his book, he describes the eye as a terrible weapon that House Cannith was building underneath the city in a place called Clawrift. Khalar also thinks that the person who stole the book might be working for House Cannith; she was at least Cyrian. House Tharashk was at least hoping to keep the book as a bargaining chip against house Cannith.

  

Knowing they’re under some time pressure, the group doesn’t offer to look for the book now, but Galen does assure Lumiz that if they come across on their travels, they’ll be sure to return it here.

  

With the lockdown on the compound lifted, Beck suggests they go check out the ship, not quite trusting that it hasn't been sabotaged somehow either. They rush towards the docks, finding the ship in one piece; except for the rope to the anchor, which has been cut, leaving the ship drifting away from the shore.

  

Both Beck and Galen jump into the water to try and swim after the ship and the torn rope dangling from it, but as they reach the ship, it’s started floating up and they’re unable to get up there. Thankfully, Petr is able to use his flying mount to get to the ship, turning on the engine and steering the ship back towards shore.

  

Beck and Galen swim back to shore where they, with the aid of Bonzo, who reduces the weight and size of the anchor that’s now stuck on the bottom of the harbor, manage to pull the anchor from the water. Beck then takes the two torn ends of the rope, realising that there’s scorch marks on them. He uses Mending to fix the rope and once Bonzo’s spell ends, the anchor is restored once more.

  

Catching their breath for a moment, the group agrees that it’s crystal clear that someone’s trying to slow them down; first by trying to frame them for attacking Lumiz, now by trying to sabotage their ship. After some discussion, they decide to take the ship and simply fly over land towards the Gold Dragon Inn, where Beck and Petr remain aboard the Heritage as Galen, Rydia and Bonzo head inside the inn to go talk to the dragonborn guide that was recommend to Galen; Azaka.

  

Inside the inn, they approach the bartender. Bonzo orders some Tej as Galen asks about the dragonborn, who is quickly pointed out to them. They’re pointed to a figure slouched over a table, a large hat on his head. As they approach the table, both Rydia and Galen spot a plaque on the wall with a single golden coin with blood on it, recognizing it as one of the golden coins that was used in their first encounter with the lady with the golden scythe.

  

With a bottle of Tej in hand, they join Azaka at his table, waking him up from his drunken slumber. As he sits up they can see that he’s a blue scaled dragonborn, noting the large horn protruding from the hat he’s wearing. Galen offers him a drink and there’s some brief banter during which Azaka calls Galen a prince.

  

Galen is quick to ask about the temple, which Azaka says he is indeed familiar with. He doesn’t fancy going there himself, but once Galen mentions they have an airship and they can fly there, he’s less reluctant. Azaka mentions that going by air is certainly faster, but they’ll have to be sure to detour around this lighthouse called Fire Finger. Other than that, he doesn’t foresee any troubles for their trip.

  

Rydia asks him if anyone else has approached him for directions to the temple, to which Azaka says that hasn’t been the case. When asked why he doesn’t want to go back to the temple, or to Haka’torvhak, Azaka says there’s lizardfolk living there and they’re bad news: they don’t like visitors.

  

As the group still wants to go, he tells them his fee is 20gld a day and that he thinks they can get there in about two and a half days. Rydia asks how long it’ll take someone on foot or on ground to get there, to which Azaka says that someone on foot will have to travel for about 7 to 8 days.

  

This prompts Galen to suggest they leave right now, which Azaka at first is hesitant about, but they managed to convince him regardless. They ask him what kind of supplies they might need and quickly head back in town to grab those supplies.

  

Rydia, Galen and Bonzo also drop by the post office, where both Rydia and Galen send messages to their parents and sister respectively. Bonzo finds he’s received a response to his letter he sent to the architects; it’s from Tesser Doras d'Sivis. The message thanks him for bringing this to their attention and promises they’ll look into it with the Brelish king. He’s also invited to come visit Tesser in person, who he knows is in Trolanport. Bonzo quickly writes a reply to this letter, sending that off.

  

Whilst the others are the post office, Beck takes the time to visit the bathhouse and temple to Olladra. Walking inside, the place is absolutely magnificent, beautifully decorated, with a minstrel playing near a large statue of Olladra. There’s a woman in white garb, wearing a symbol of Olladra around her neck, but Beck simply heads to the statue, sitting down in front of it.

  

Like before, he pulls out the tarot deck that used to belong to his wife, asking it for guidance before he pulls a card from it. It’s the Emperor, which he knows means authority, structure. Seeing the card gives him a sense of calm. He takes another moment at the temple, then returns to the airship and meets up with the others.

  

With everyone aboard the ship, Azaka having had to be dragged aboard the ship as he was already somewhat too drunk, they take off. They agree to take shifts throughout the night so they can keep going and make good time.

  

Having left off in the late afternoon, it’s not long before they find themselves surrounded by an ocean of trees, heading into the night. Rydia, who doesn’t need to sleep, stays on the deck as the others rest up, taking turns to accompany her to make sure no one’s alone on deck at any time.

  

Galen is the first to join Rydia on the deck. They hear insect noises below, but nothing else of note draws their attention, the skies around them clear. “So this whole not sleeping thing, is that just … permanent?” Galen asks Rydia, to which she says she doesn’t know what is permanent and what is not. She says she does still feel tired sometimes, but she doesn’t feel like she needs to sleep to shake that off anymore.

  

She turns the conversation to titles; first mates and authority figures and princes, to which Galen says he doesn’t really like any of it. Rydia jokes about calling him her prince, which Galen says he would probably let her get away with. “But just so we’re clear, I left Sharn for a reason and I have no intention of going back,” Galen then adds, to which Rydia says she’s not offended that he didn’t tell her about the full extent of his family business. Galen goes on to say he didn’t and doesn’t want that life, which Rydia says she understand.

  

“Well I’m glad you understand, because my parents sure as hell don’t,” Galen adds, Rydia saying her parents don’t really understand either. Galen’s unsure if his dad will appreciate what he did, Rydia asking him if he cares. “He’s still my dad, I still care about him. I just don’t wanna be his firstborn heir, that’s all.”

  

“So you are something of a prince?” Rydia asks, Galen explaining that they are rich, but it’s not like they’re nobility or part of a dragonmarked house. His father is part of the Aurum, a collection of wealthy industrialists and businessmen, that try to form a united front of counter balance against the dragonmarked houses. Galen doesn’t share that specifically though.

  

He does promise to one day take Rydia home with him, so she can see what it’s like to grow up in the fancy part of Sharn. “I can take you to one of those absolutely ridiculous fancy parties, if you want,” he offers, which Rydia doesn’t think is a bad idea; she has the mask for it now.

  

Saying he still needs to get some sleep, Galen then excuses himself and goes to wake Bonzo, who takes over watch, joining Rydia on the deck as well. Keeping an eye out, neither of them really notice anything worth investigating.

  

Now that it’s just the two of them, Bonzo takes his chance to apologise to Rydia. “I’m sorry for what happened at Lumiz’s, that I quickly went inside. Sometimes I’m still, I dunno, a bit shaken by your appearance,” he says, continuing by saying that’s his fault, and that he shouldn’t be afraid. Or maybe he should be, but either way he felt like he should apologise for avoiding her.

  

“Thank you, but I don’t know if you should or shouldn’t be afraid. I am often afraid myself,” Rydia admits, pointing out that she thinks his hesitation towards her might just be sane. Bonzo says that maybe it does make sense, but he points out that she seems well intentioned, and that sometimes feels at odds with what he sees her change into. “It is a bit of a frightful appearance,” he says, before once again saying he felt like he should apologise. “I’ll try not to avoid you anymore.” Rydia thanks him, accepting his apology.

  

There’s a moment of silence, which soon turns awkward before Bonzo excuses himself and goes to work on Betsy for a little while. He then goes back to bed, waking up Beck for the final watch.

  

Also joining Rydia on deck, Beck and Rydia look around, keeping an eye on their surroundings. Rydia gets distracted by one of the moons that’s now in clear view; Lharvion, also known as the Eye. There’s a black gash along the moon, right across it’s dull white surface, making it look like an eye. This isn’t out of the ordinary, but it’s been a while since she’s seen this particular moon.

  

Beck asks her what she’s looking at, so Rydia looks away, pointing at the moon. “It looked like something,” Rydia says, suddenly speaking in draconic, which Beck speaks. He asks her why she’s suddenly speaking in draconic, in draconic, which Rydia then in turn doesn’t understand. When she seems confused, he tells her she was speaking draconic all the sudden. “I’d like to say I don’t speak draconic, but ..” Rydia trails off, saying she believes Beck when he says she was indeed speaking that language.

  

Meanwhile, the ship is approaching a mesa in the distance as Beck suggests that perhaps her speaking draconic has to do with what happened: she did read a book by a dragon. Rydia goes to say something, but doesn’t, keeping quiet, prompting Beck to say he knows she doesn’t like to talk about this.

  

He turns the conversation back to the moon, though Rydia points out there was nothing actually weird about it other than it looks like an eye. “Many eyes today,” Beck points out, to which Rydia points out it seems to be a theme of sorts lately. “They don’t help me to see better,” Rydia points out, referring to her own extra eyes, “unless when I’m trying to see something specific, like when I was trying to follow your friend.”

  

Beck points out friend is somewhat of an overstatement as Rydia says she could still see him after he moved away. When Beck says that’s a good thing, Rydia says it’s not good enough. “We have … problems,” she says. “And they’re all people. That part is probably the scariest; I can do something about that and .. part of me wants to.” Beck asks her what she wants to do, to which Rydia says she wants to remove the problem.

  

“Seeing them. Finding them…” “And then what?” Beck asks, before asking Rydia if she wants to listen to the part of her that wants to consume those people. “I don’t know,” she admits. “It’s all very new.” She goes on to say that she stops herself, but when she stopped herself last time, the person she was going after shot the captain.

  

“As long as you’re still in control of it, that’s good, right?” Beck asks, before going on to say that, maybe not everyone, but some people deserve to be eaten. As the sun starts to rise, they get even closer to the mesa they saw before. Rydia notices a number of silhouettes on top of it, three of them, dressed in black flowy clothing. All of them seem to be staring at the airship.
