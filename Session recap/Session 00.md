# Session 00

##### Petr, D4 and Beck

Though the war is mostly behind you, the tensions in the continent of Khorvaire and the world of Eberron are still high. The last couple of days have been a nailbiter for the crew of the Heritage. With the rotor smoking, they’ve been limping their way along the outskirts of Gatherhold. 

  

It’s nighttime when they drop anchor right above the agreed upon drop off point, above an abandoned crevasse. Three of the twelve moons are visible in the night sky, leaving it quite dark out. Through the bit of moonlight, they can still see the abandoned dwellings in the rocks. 

  

In the distance, they see the many bonfires of Gatherhold light up; it’s extremely busy here because of the Week of Gathering. Almost all of the tribes of the plains are here for the festivities. A little further away, Lake Cyre glows eerily bioluminescent blue, a stark reminder of the Day of Mourning that happened not four years ago. 

  

They have some time to kill before their contact arrives and the group discusses Gatherhold, and why some of them are happy to be here. D4 is on the search for a piece of dragonshard; the last component he needs to finish building his drone. He’s heard he might be able to find a dragonshard at the lightning rail that once ran through Cyre, which is now a dead end outside of town. 

  

Petr is also excited to be here; he’s looking for a stiff drink, and looks forward to meeting new people and seeing new sights. D4 asks about the large number of ‘small people’ here, to which Petr points out they seem to be about D4’s size, before he remembers that D4 is a little sensitive about his height. 

  

The captain emerges from below deck, addressing the group. “Okay so, our contact is supposedly coming soon-ish. If you can get the ship to ground level so that they might inspect the wares, I think that’ll be good. I’m going into town for a bit on my own, just to set up some meetings for us tomorrow. We desperately need some work, and I’m also interested in maybe finding us a flying dinosaur; just y’know, to do tours around the ship whilst we’re mid flight, maybe send someone down as a runner as opposed to having to bringing the entire ship down.” She would like something not mechanical for this. 

She excuses herself, assuring the group everything should go as planned, reminding them that the name of their contact was Dugorim. Before she leaves, D4 asks about the warforged. She tells him they’re dropping them off tonight, so D4 asks again if he can’t take one of their legs. “We should try to avoid any conflict with these guys, we’ll see if we can find you a scrapper in town.” 

She tosses the ladder overboard and starts climbing down. As the captain heads into the town, the others drop the anchor, which increases in weight and starts pulling the ship down as it hits the ground. They’re slowly lowered to the ground, looking around to try and keep an eye out for this contact that’s supposed to arrive. 

They’re all somewhat distracted by this new city though, but successfully bring the ship to the ground and then wait for the contact to arrive. They consider looking around for a moment, then simply stay put and wait. 

About thirty to forty minutes later, two shapes come wandering into this crevasse they’re parked in. One of them is a white furred minotaur, with two manacles on his arms that have been snapped. He has two massive black horns, one of them broken. Next to him, equally large, yet somehow seeming smaller next to the minotaur is an orc. He has one nasty scar across his face, over his lip, with thick sideburns framing his face. The orc isn’t armed, the minotaur is carrying a massive battle axe. 

They approach the boat. “Good evening,” the orc says, addressing whoever’s in charge, to which Beck says that technically he’s the one in charge. He asks for the goods, so Beck asks for the pay. Dugorim complains about the trailing smoke cloud the ship left behind, he was hoping for a bit more carefulness. Beck points out they ran into some trouble; they need the money to be able to fix the ship. 

Beck leads Dugorim down below to take a look at the Warforged as Plucky, the minotaur, stays outside. D4 quietly prods at Beck, asking if they shouldn’t wait for the captain, to which Beck points out he doesn’t think the captain will be back in time. “We can handle it.” 

The deck below is modest, and currently rather full with about 17 derelict Warforged, which gives off an eerie vibe of these undead faces staring. Dugorim wanders around a bit, inspecting the merchandise, before turning to Beck. “It appears there’s only 17, I thought we agreed on 20.” 

  

D4 says they ate three, which Dugorim clearly doesn’t buy. As D4 asks what they’re going to use them for, Dugorim says that it’s part of the deal that that’s none of their business. He asks Beck what happened to the last three, and Beck says they ran into trouble gathering these, which Dugorim points out seems to be a theme for them. “Trouble sometimes follows us around, but we delivered 17 of these - do you not want them?”

  

Dugorim says he’s not interested; he wants his money back, largely because everyone saw their ship arrive, and he’s no longer interested in this trade. D4 points out that this was not the agreement as Petr suggests they wait for the captain coming back. Beck then suggests he can still take these 17, and they give him a discount. Dugorim is convinced enough to agree to take this offer back to his boss, and he says they can meet up again tomorrow to discuss this. 

  

“Swing by tomorrow evening, we run a little tavern near the docks called the Glowing Kipper. Ask for a lily.” He says he’ll go reconvene with his contacts, “I’ll see what I can do, but it’s not looking pretty.” He will take his leave, heading out along with Plucky. As the two of them head out, three more figures join them out of the shadows, all of them wielding heavy crossbows. It seems they came prepared for when things went south. 

  

Petr points out it seems they brought backup, as D4 expresses confusion about how the deal wasn’t held up. Petr tells him that yes, humanoids do usually keep their promises, but not all of them. They know that if this deal goes south, they’re missing out on another 700 gold of this deal. Petr does some quick calculations on the discount, thinking it should still be a fair deal. 

  

“Still wondering why he needs them in the first place, and why he wouldn’t tell us,” Petr says, and they agree it’s likely something shady, and they might not want to know. Beck points out they likely wouldn’t appreciate them making it their business, so they let it go, even if D4 still says he doesn’t understand their logic. 

  

Now left to their own devices, they decide to head into town. They know they need some supplies; largely steel, so they’re able to fix the rotor. After they get off the ship, they speak the command word for the anchor, ‘korrah’, watching as the ship floats back up into the sky, safely out of harm’s way. 

  

It’s chilly as they head into town and they find that Gatherhold itself is basically two large walls of a canyon that recedes into Lake Cyre. At this point, there’s a massive tent city in the center of town, all halflings that are here as part of the festivities. They enter this tent town, spotting large pens that hold dinosaurs, various market stalls and people selling their wares, trading stories. 

  

There’s also a couple of actual regular businesses in the center of town, inside rocks jutting out of the ground. Eventually, the canyon meets Lake Cyre, splitting the town in two. They look around, trying to find steel somewhere. 

  

Asking around, Beck speaks to a couple of halflings. Most of them are only wearing pants or slacks, and all of them are wearing elaborate masks or helmets made of bone. They’re drinking out of hollowed out pieces of ivory, some drinking out of mugs as well; they’re having the time of their lives. 

  

Most of them are really friendly as the group approaches them, happy to see other people here. Beck says they’re looking for steel, and they’re pointed in the direction of a repair shop called Nine Quick Fingers, which is in the harbor. They’re given directions on how to get there as well. Via the walls on the right they’ll eventually walk right into it. 

  

As they head that way, D4 asks Beck what these halflings are doing, Beck confirming they’re dancing and drinking. D4 tries to imitate this dancing by stomping his pneumatic arm into the ground repeatedly. They wonder what happened to the repair shop owner’s tenth finger as they continue heading that way. 

  

Walking through this huge market, they see the captain emerging from one of the rock buildings. The building reads Glamorously Gratifying Delights; a central pillar with a building facade visible in the rock. There’s a big purple awning, gorgeous sign above it; it looks like a swanky place. 

  

The captain meets up with the group, who asks if they’re spending money, as things went by quickly. Beck, D4 and Petr update her on what happened with Dugorim, to which Fianin points out that the name ‘Glowing Kipper’ sounds entirely made up. Petr points out that ‘Mister Plucky’ also sounds like a fake name, Beck explaining to the captain that Dugorim brought a large minotaur with him by that name.

  

The captain then updates them all on what she’s been doing. She managed to get them an appointment at the brothel she just came out of; it’s owned by a Ghallanda halfling who should be well connected. She’s hoping to get a job out of that connection. She also made arrangements with a member of the council of tribes, who told her that the dinosaur thing was a closely guarded secret, but he might be able to help them out with that. 

  

D4 points out that all these potential jobs mean they should really repair the rotor, and they tell the captain they were en route to a repair shop. The captain joins them, saying she’d really like to get that flying dinosaur. 

  

Heading through town, they see some building facades along the way. First one they pass is a facade with five large columns, which looks like an official government building. It says in halfling, which Fianin translates; ‘Gatherhold Hall’. The other massive building face they pass contains stonework of a large dragon. It says ‘Golden Dragon Inn’, in common. Which is a common inn, run by House Ghallanda; this one appears to be their headquarters. It looks like a really fancy hotel, which is a strange sight in this place.

  

As they pass by the harbor, the atmosphere changes; becomes a bit more industrial. There’s more metal being used, there’s warehouses, large bridges that span the chasm. Heading to the right side of this chasm, they find that most businesses here are clearly closed. They eventually find the small ramshackle shop with a little brass sign hanging in front of it that says ‘Nine Quick Fingers’. 

  

Wasting no time, D4 starts to run, exciting about all the bolts and screws he can already see. The door isn’t locked and they head inside, their arrival announced with a bell ringing. Next to a small furnace, screwdriver in mouth and large looking glass in between his eyebrow and his cheek, is a soot stained halfling, with greasy black hair and one missing pinky finger. 

  

He’s working on a small contraption, speaking to the group with the screwdriver still in his mouth, telling them he’ll be right there. He puts the contraption aside, sticking out his soot stained hand before pulling it back, wiping it off his apron before properly greeting the group. 

  

“What can I help you with?” D4 compliments the store. There’s all types of material around the store, as well as trinkets and other such objects. “Well you’re a fun little specimen,” he says to D4, who explains that he wasn’t supposed to be little. The halfling apologises, saying he’s just interested in all the shapes and sizes warforged come in. 

  

D4 then asks for steel to repair their ship, and he also asks for a dragonshard. The halfling says he doesn’t have any dragonshards, but steel he does have. He has ingots; he goes into the back and there’s a massive cupboard with small little cubbies out of which he gathers pieces of steel. The ingots are stamped with the crown of Breland. 

  

He asks what the steel is for, and D4 tells him they need to fix the rotor, and they should need about 3 ingots for that. The halfling explains those are about 50 gold per piece, to which the captain says they don’t really have enough money for three of those. She explains some of the money situation to the halfling, apologising to him and saying they’ll come back tomorrow once they can afford the steel they need. 

  

Though he’s sad about the steel, D4 still asks about the dragonshards, specifically about where to find them. The halfling explains they’re a popular thing; there used to be a large lightning rail running from the Mournland to here, but most of that has been picked clean by local hooligans. “They tend to charge a hefty sum, you might be able to barter for them, maybe do an odd job here and there,” the halfling says. “The ones that I know have them are probably the Jackdaws, they tend to hang out in the Salty Hag. It’s a festhall, a little bit more townside.” 

  

As they leave, Fianin pats D4 on the shoulder, assuring him they’ll get him the tools he needs to fix up the ship so they can get the hell out of there. 

  

They head back; there’s various festivities around town. After some discussion, they decide to head to the Salty Hag to see if they can find out more about the Jackdaws and the dragonshard. They start heading to the festhall, pointed in the right direction by the halfling. 

  

The festhall is right on the cusp of the docks and the town itself; on the outside they can see two windows that are full of grime. Warm lights flicker on the inside and they can hear laughter from inside, clanking of mugs. As they open the door they can see it’s a relatively small place. The tavern smells off fish and their feet almost immediately stick to the floor a bit. Most of the tables are upside down sloops with candles melting all over them, and there’s a giant swordfish decoration the area above the bar.

  

There’s a bald man with a thick, red nose behind the bar, a miserable looking person with simple black clothing who’s standing behind the bar, almost too tired to end his shift. The place itself is mainly filled with drinking halflings, but they also spot a single goblin sitting in the corner, quietly sipping a drink and reading a book. 

  

They agree to have some drinks, with the captain offering to pay, so Petr heads to the bar and orders them all a round of ale, with a cup of oil for D4. The barkeep says they don’t have oil, offers some fish guts instead, which Petr agrees to. As Petr pays with gold, he’s given a large amount of copper in turn; the bartender apologises, saying that they seem to be mysteriously running out of silver in the town. He mentions people are talking about disappearing pieces of silverware; he was hoping for some new silver with the influx of all these halflings, but there’s hardly any real money going around. The barkeep also stresses he doesn’t want the group to kill anyone; he seems a little paranoid. 

  

Petr brings the drinks back to the group, D4 asking what his drink is and Petr and Beck explaining what it is. “Will it grease my nuts?” He then drinks it anyway. Other than the strange paranoia of the barkeep, they don’t really notice anything out of sorts around this place. Petr and Beck do take a look at the goblin, but he seems to be minding his own business. He’s reading a book, he has black, slicked back hair, one hooped golden earring. 

  

D4 asks if this is a dancing place as well, to which the barkeep explains it’s not much of one anymore. D4 still dances, before he asks about the Jackdaw hooligans, purposely asking very loudly. The barkeep says he better not call them hooligans; the Jackdaws are pretty well respected in the docks. They gave a lot of people their jobs back after the war. “It’s been a tough time with Cyre turning into the Mourland; dried up most of our trade. The docks and Gatherhold aren’t what they used to be.” 

  

Both Beck and Petr notice that at the mention of the Jackdaws, the goblin seems to perk up, looking over at the group from over his book. Petr points this out to D4 and the captain as well, Beck suggesting they should buy the goblin a drink. Petr gives Beck some money for a drink, D4 suggesting they get the goblin some of the fish guts. Beck tells D4 that’s the special stuff, and they reserve that for D4. “I feel special now.”

  

Beck goes to get a drink and moves over towards the goblin, who puts his book down. The title of the book is ‘A compact history of Cyre’. He asks Beck to what he owes the tasty beverage, which Beck at first doesn’t answer, instead pointing out the interesting book he’s reading. “It is, it is. I’ve been quite a Cyrialite myself, I just, love their culture, the fact that they were the best.” Beck says he agrees, then realises that sounds slightly braggy as he’s from there.

  

“You escaped the Mourning? That’s quite the feat in itself.” He asks if Beck was there, which Beck says he wasn’t. “That would explain it then.” He then brings the conversation back around to the question he first asked. Beck says that his friend over there - the excited dancing warforged - is interested in a dragonshard. “We were told the Jackdaws might have some leads on that, and you seemed to perk up when they were mentioned.” 

  

He says he does dabble with the Jackdaws quite a bit, and that they might possibly still have some dragonshards available. “The ones we have were mainly used by the lightning rail system, I don’t know if that’s an issue.” Beck says he doesn’t think so. “By the way, how are you in .. do you have any trinkets of home? Anything tangible from the old kingdom?” Beck mistakenly thinks he’s asking if Beck wants to sell some of what he might have; the goblin instead meant he thought Beck might be interested in buying some. 

  

He then goes on to say that his boss is a very private person and he doesn’t like it here when it’s busy; “Might I suggest you come back here tomorrow, preferably in the afternoon when it’s still quiet. I’ll bring some dragonshards, you bring some money…” Beck agrees to this, though also asks if perhaps instead of money, services could also be a feasible payment. The goblin says that yes, his boss might be interested in some tasks getting done. 

  

“Anything else I should pass on?,” the goblin asks, to which Beck points out they do have possession of an airship. The goblin instantly deduces they came in via the smoking airship. He says he might be able to help with fixing up the airship, before he asks what they’re transporting. Beck is purposely vague when it comes to the details, willing to divulge some information, but claiming he doesn’t know the details. 

  

The goblin seems to understand Beck’s unwillingness to divulge more details, saying they’ll definitely have some work and, if their deal tomorrow goes south, the Jackdaws might be interested in buying whatever they’re hauling as well. “We have a large network.” Beck, in turn, offers to share stories of Cyre, which the goblin does seem interested in, after he’s finished reading his book. 

  

Beck rejoins the others, and they eventually retreat for the night, heading back to the airship and getting some sleep whilst D4 gets some more work done on his drone. 

  

The next morning comes, the sun is bright. Eerie blue glow of Lake Cyre is replaced by a general fogginess that creeps over the lake and into the town. In town, there are halflings walking around, pouring massive amounts of white sand; using large triceratops as mules and pouring the sand in a figure eight of sorts in the market. 

  

As they’re walking into town, the captain suggests they take two meetings at the same time, to expedite the four meetings they have that day. Their first meetings are with the lady at the brothel and the councilmen, with later the meeting with the Jackdaws, as well as their meeting at the Glowing Kipper. Fianin suggests they go to the Glowing Kipper together, as strength in numbers might work in their advantage for that one. 

  

Petr agrees to go with the captain to the meeting with the councilman, as Beck and D4 agree to head to the brothel and speak with Rosevyr Ghallanda. Before they part ways, Beck checks in with the captain what exactly they were hoping to get from Rosevyr. Fianin tells him that Rosevyr Ghallanda runs the brothel, and she’s an information broker. She’s one of the Sisters of Sin, and the brothel here is part of a network of brothels that sell information. She should have a job for them, and, whilst they’re there, they could ask for some information as well. The group quickly talks about what they want to know more about, deciding to ask about the missing silver, as well as maybe Dugorim and Plucky and whoever they work with. 

  

The brothel is closer, so Beck and D4 split off first, heading inside. Though the facade outside is beautiful, and the inside is also well decorated, it also comes across as a little tacky. There’s thick, purple curtains, and paintings of naked people in garden scenes decorating the place.

  

They’re greeted by an older looking halfling woman, wearing a gold and blue dress. her hair is up in a bun and she’s wearing glasses and carrying a notebook in one hand, a quill in the other. Beck tells her they have a meeting with Rosevyr Ghallanda, and she confirms that’s her, before looking over at a servant, who instantly starts getting a table ready for the three of them.

  

As they take a seat at this table, Rosevyr properly introduces herself. She explains that her last name is Ghallanda, and not d’Ghallanda, as she doesn’t associate with her house anymore. They apparently deemed her profession not worthy of a Dragonmarked house. Beck and D4 introduce themselves, after which Rosevyr asks Beck if he’s Cyrian. When he confirms this, she tells him that he in particular might find some of the information she has interesting.

  

She goes on to tell them that an Aundarian nobleman found himself in bed with one of her most popular humans, and during this time he shared some information she wants looked into. She calls out for a man named Evveryn, who she explains is the human that this Aundarian nobleman shared his bed with. 

  

This nobleman apparently spoke of something that’s been retrieved from the Mournland, that will be taken to Fairhaven by lightning rail in about six days time. Rosevyr wants someone to take this something from them. As she finishes telling Beck and D4 about this, they’re joined by a human male. He has dark hair, a mustache, and is wearing a cropped short that’s barely tied together across his waist. He’s clearly either still drunk or somewhat hungover, but upon Rosevyr’s request, he shares more of what he heard.

  

“They’re transporting something for Errold ir'Lain. It’s an art piece of someone named Yonhanna d’Cannith,” Evveryn explains. Beck recognises this name, knowing that Yonhanna d’Cannith was a great Cyrian architect. Rosevyr seems to note the fact that Beck recognises this name, but doesn’t otherwise ask about it. 

  

Beck and D4 assure her this sounds interesting, but they’d have to talk to their captain before agreeing to take on any kind of mission. Rosevyr then asks if there’s anything else she can help them with, and Beck tells her they do have some more questions, asking if perhaps she has information about the missing silver. 

  

She tells them that she is aware of silver having gone missing and getting stolen, and she’s heard rumors of feathered women who ask for silver. They seem to seduce people into giving them this silver, to which D4 asks what seduction is. Beck points out it’s what happens in this brothel, and Evveryn leans in closer, attempting to demonstrate how seduction works.

  

Beck then asks about Dugorim and Plucky, to which Rosevyr admits she does know about them. She seems unwilling to divulge a lot of details, but when Beck says he simply wants to know who they’re dealing with, she does tell him that they’re known for being somewhat aggressive. 

  

With some of their questions answered, Beck asks Rosevyr when she would like to know whether or not they want to take the job, and she tells him and D4 that she’d like an answer within 3 days. They take their leave then, heading outside to go and meet up with the others. As they walk around town, they notice some massive dinosaurs, being accompanied by halflings as they walk around the town. They seem to have racing stripes painted on their backs.

  

Meanwhile, Fianin and Petr have gone to meet up with the councilman, Anders Solomar, who Fianin explains might be able to help them get that flying dinosaur she’s so interested in. They enter into a massive hall, which seems largely empty, with no real designated areas except for what looks like an audience area. There’s two small, halfling sized doors on either side of the hall, and it’s quiet; they seem to be alone in the building.

  

The captain calls out, asking if anyone’s there and then one of the doors on the side opens up and an ornately dressed halfling man emerges. He’s ornately dressed in strange black and white attire, with a pointy hat in the same colors. He’s also wearing a golden necklace and carries a gold and wooden walking stick.

  

He approaches Fianin and Petr, introducing himself before telling them that he wanted to meet them here, so he could show them more of the cultural side of this town. He’s been hard at work making Talenta a civilised country. After Anders introduces himself, Petr returns the favor, introducing himself as well as the captain, before the captain reminds Anders they’re here to talk about the flying dinosaurs.

  

Anders says the dinosaurs are a well kept secret, and that he doesn’t think he can help, but Petr quickly deduces that there seems to be more to it than that. He asks Anders if there’s perhaps some way to convince him to help them out, and Anders quickly admits that there might be something they can do. He’s looking for a small crew to investigate a tragedy. 

  

“About ten years ago, a large vein of platinum was discovered in Talenta. We tried to set up a mining town there, with a mixed bunch of people working there. It was a town called Krezent. Three years ago, part of this mine collapsed, killing sixty miners,” Anders explains. He goes on to say that many of the people here now believe Krezent to be a cursed place; that it’s haunted, and therefore they refuse to return there.

  

He wants someone to go there, look into what actually happened and hopefully find proof that this was a naturally occurring accident, and that there’s no curse to speak off. That way, they can turn Talenta into a proper civilization again. He promises a reward of 500 gold, for them finding evidence of what happened and, if anything dangerous is still there, to kill that as well.

  

Fianin says that, though they’re interested, they’re going to need to fix their ship before they get there, and Anders is quick to ask what they’ll need to be able to fix their ship. Petr and the captain point out they’ll need 3 silver ingots, as well as a dragonshard, to which Anders says that at the very least, the ingots shouldn’t be a problem. He will look into the dragonshard as well. The captain says that she’ll need to discuss this with the others, but it does seem like a good deal.

  

They say their goodbyes and leave, reconvening with the others near one of the markets. The halflings are now drawing racing lines with the white sand, clearly setting up for the race that’s about to happen. As they’re looking around, both Beck and Petr hear singing.  They initially think nothing of it, until a large tyrannosaurus rex walks by with its handler, and the t-rex, previously calm, suddenly seems to react to the singing.

  

The t-rex’s eyes glow red with madness and it starts running, right at the group. It bites at Petr, who manages to duck out of the way. Beck attempts to blind the t-rex, but the spell doesn’t take. He then turns his attention to Petr, inspiring him as D4 digs up a vial of grease, throwing it right in front of the t-rex. It slips, and falls to its side. 

  

Petr casts Shillelagh on his weapon before swinging at the t-rex, hitting, though then turning towards the group, telling them to not kill it. The captain takes out her crossbow and takes a shot, hitting, before calling out to Petr to try and hit the t-rex in the head to hopefully knock it out. Petr does so, but it doesn’t quite knock the dino out yet. Being this close to the t-rex, it’s easy enough for Petr to see that it’s not quite in it’s right mind.

  

The t-rex tries to bite at Petr again, hitting as it’s owner comes running up. “Banana Candy, it’s okay,” the halfling says, trying to calm the t-rex down, to no avail. It swings its tail in the direction of Beck and D4, but both of them manage to jump out of the way. 

  

Still hearing the singing, Beck looks around, trying to see where it’s coming from. He spots it relatively easily; up on the bridge-like structure that oversees the market there’s a harpy with brightly colored feathers. He reaches out with his violin, producing a high, sharp note to cast Dissonant Whispers, which causes the harpy to instantly stop singing and start flying away instead, grasping at her head in pain. 

  

Unfortunately, her singing seems to have a lasting effect on the t-rex, who still seems enraged. D4 runs back, getting swiped at by the t-rex as he does so, before he uses his pneumatic arm, releasing his fist and shooting it at the t-rex, hitting. Petr, now having noticed the harpy as well, points at her and casts Toll the Dead, which hits, leaving her struggling to stay aloft.

  

Fianin climbs onto the building nearby, taking a shot at the harpy with her crossbow but she misses, the harpy a little too far away. She then turns to D4, rallying him as the t-rex finally seems to shake it’s anger, his trainer calming the creature down some more. The harpy then flies down, now engaging with the group, targeting the captain with her song and managing to charm her. Fianin starts walking in the direction of the harpy. 

  

Beck simply repeats what he did before, casting Dissonant Whispers once more, which is enough to kill the harpy, who falls to the ground up on the bridge it was on before. With the threat seemingly dealt with, the t-rex’s owner, introducing himself as Yasseem, thanks the group for their help. He does also point out Banana Candy might not be able to race anymore, as he got hurt, to which Petr quickly casts Cure Wounds, wanting to help. 

  

To thank the group, Yasseem gives them a wooden coin, engraved with the visage of a triceratops. He explains they can give this to his brother, who does the bookkeeping for this racing event, and they can use it to put a bet on any of the competing dinosaurs. They should easily be able to spot his brother, as he wears a bright yellow hat.

  

They say their goodbyes to Yasseem and Banana Candy and climb up onto the bridge to take a look at the corpse of the harpy. Upon closer inspection it seems that her wings have been painted; some of the blood having washed the paint away, revealing the naturally grey wings underneath. She’s not carrying much, but in a leather pouch they do find 13 pieces of silver, as well as a silver fork and knife, and a small satchel filled with a strange powder.

  

Petr almost instantly recognises the powder, knowing it to be Dream Lily, a psychoactive drug. The group notes that this is not the first time they’ve encountered a “lily” in the past few days; they were also told to ask for a lily at the Glowing Kipper. Petr knows that Dream Lily is illegal in most of the Five Nations, but he’s unsure about the rules here in Talenta.

  

Knowing they still have other meetings to go to, they all start heading towards the Salty Hag, discussing harpies and whether or not this one was acting on her own. As they walk away from the market, the races are underway, most people having gone there, which leaves the streets largely abandoned. Most of the docks are devout of life as well, which seems to be what the goblin’s contact would prefer. 

  

As they approach the Salty Hag, the group sees a figure emerge from the festhall. It’s a floating woman, wearing a golden mask of a skull and a long, black dress. She’s wielding a massive golden scythe and is followed by four other figures; pale men, who seem to all be carrying a dead body. 

  

The woman raises up her scythe, slashing it through the air, somehow creating a tear in the fabric of this plane, revealing a space scape of sorts. As her henchmen move in through this tear she created, the woman spots the group. She smiles, wiggling her finger at them and as soon as she does so, all of them instantly forgot they just saw this happen. 

  

She steps through the tear and it disappears and the group are left none the wiser, simply continuing on their way towards the Salty Hag. As they step inside, everyone inside the bar seems to be on edge. The barkeep is cowering in fear behind the bar, the goblin just sheathing a weapon as next to him a bugbear and two humanoid creatures look equally panicked. 

##### Damned and Galen

The last couple of days have been a snooze-fest for Galen and Rydia. Gatherhold, as it turns out, is boring - but yesterday, that changed. Tribes from all over the plains arrived with their herds and tents. Today, the central part of town, Qinweft village, is filled with tents and animal pens. Goods are unloaded from massive stegosauruses and various market stalls are being set up. There's even some dwarves and humans peddling their wares.

A large track is being cleared in the center of town in the form of a figure eight, and halflings are pouring white sand over the rocky ground. In a couple of hours the famous Talenta Dinosaur Race will start. A true spectacle, according to the locals, that also involves a lot of gambling. This year it will be a bit different though, because a lot of the town's silver has started to disappear in the last couple of days.

  

The spring air is crisp as Rydia and Galen gaze out across the central village below, leaning on the balcony of their room in the Golden Dragon Inn. Run by House Ghallanda, the inn is strangely luxurious for the town, with the balcony offering a perfect view. Since arriving in town, Galen has mostly been in contact with a bugbear named Orryn and a goblin, Grek. Part of the Jackdaws Gang, the odd jobs have helped them pay their way, but Galen and Rydia are still short of a way out of town. Having been advised by the Jackdaws that their best bet would be the Week of Gathering, this would be the best time to try and find an alternative to the Lightning Rail, which is infrequent and runs north, towards Karrnath. 

  

Having spent some time in a less than perfect state, Rydia seems to be back to her old self, telling Galen she’s ready to get out and explore town a bit. Concerned, he asks if she’s sure she’s feeling better, which she reassures him she is. Suggesting they take the chance and place some bets, the two can see the town setting up a starting line, the riders getting ready for the start of the events. Although not opposed to having some fun, Galen admits he’s slightly confused by all this, which Rydia says she understands. “If you want, we could stay in and have some fun,” she offers, which Galen says he wouldn’t be opposed to either. Regardless, he asks again if she’s sure she’s okay, which Rydia responds to by asking if they can just enjoy this. Galen accepts the suggestion, asking if they want to go bet on some dinosaurs, which Rydia immediately seems to be looking forward to.

  

Heading downstairs, the Golden Dragon Inn is carved out of the stone, Cyrian architecture that’s been neatly decorated. Magical torches line the halls, as floating disks take guests up and down the many floors of the inn. The marble floor of the entryway shines in the light, a large etching of the Mark of Hospitality carved into the stone floor of House Ghallanda’s headquarters. Heading outside, Galen and Rydia are immediately greeted by the bustle of the market, some people already into their ale as they prepare for a day of dinosaur races. After a few moments, they manage to spot a halfling with a large yellow hat, with ‘Bets here’ written on it. He rides an azure raptor through the crowd, visible above the people as Galen and Rydia approach him in the busy streets of town.

  

Talking to the halfling, he informs the pair there are races today and tomorrow - if they decide to place a bet, he’ll take the gold, keep details of what they chose, and give them a betting chip. Should they have winnings, they can return with the chip to exchange it for their gold. Asking about today’s race, the halfling runs through the racers. The safest bet is an Ankleosaurus called Dirt Stomper. A slightly riskier option is an ill tempered Allosaur called Bone Cruncher, and there’s also a T-Rex called Banana Candy, who apparently managed to push some of the race into the crowd at the last meeting. The final of the main options is Big Honker, well trained, but older and approaching retirement age. There are other options, but according to the bookie, they’d be practically throwing away their money. Rydia puts a bet of four gold on Bone Cruncher, and the bookie tells them the race should start in about an hour.

  

Moving through the rest of the market, they come across a group of wagons parked up, with blue writing on the side - ‘Soldorak Markets - Riches from the Mror Holds’. An old dwavern woman manning the stalls spots Galen and Damned, summoning them over. The three wagons are arranged with awnings over them, with one of them marked as off limits, a rusty warforged perched on the steps of the wagon. They have a number of wares on display, iron and steel ingots, a variety of gems, weapons, hexagonal playing cards, along with a small golden scarab, locked away in a cage. Galen asks about it, the woman pulling it out to demonstrate, explaining that it sings a lullaby when placed near someone’s ear. The scarab appears to be a tiny construct, which sings as the woman places it on Galen’s shoulder. 

  

Galen asks where they found it, the woman explaining that it was recovered from Soldorak - the ancient dwavern kingdom that sits under the mountains. The ancient dwarves made it, and apparently they found many other strange things down there. The woman says those things are more scary strange that just unusual though, to which Galen replies he can handle scary, encouraging the woman to tell him more. Calling her darling also seems to do the trick, as the woman goes on to explain that the clans have been fighting off eldritch horrors down there. According to her, the dwarves have a lot of work to do to defend the Mror Holds against them. The clans have been doing this for decades, the eldritch horrors long predating the dwarves. Some of the clans try to negotiate with them a bit, but in the capital of Mror, there’s rewards to be had for venturing down there. She doesn’t know if there’s much left down there in the way of treasures, as she hasn’t been down there personally. 

  

She asks if Galen has any stories of his own, Galen and Rydia casually telling her about this one time they fought a mauve dragon, Galen nearly losing an arm in the process. The woman seems fascinated, commenting they must be mighty warriors, having managed such a feat. Noticing Rydia stacking a pile of purple gems, the woman asks if they’re interested in buying any, the prices ranging from twenty gold up to the hundreds for the finer quality ones. A little low on funds, Rydia says they’ll come back should their bet go their way - “Unless there are other ways of paying”, she suggests, nudging Galen forward. Galen neatly dodges the suggestion, promising the woman, who introduces herself as Tarma, that they’ll come back if their bet goes well. 

  

“You need to stop trying to sell me as payment,” Galen warns Rydia as they walk away, although Rydia seems unbothered, pointing out that the lady liked him. Distraction comes quickly as they notice a bridge running across the market, people gathering on top to watch the races taking place below. Keen to see how their bet goes, Rydia and Galen head up to the bridge to join the crowd, watching as the dinosaurs line up below, a halfling with a pistol firing the starting gun as the dinosaurs race off around the track. 

  

After a tense race, Banana Candy takes the lead, eventually winning the race, as Bone Cruncher and Big Honker duel it out for second. As Rydia excitedly cheers on her dinosaur, Bone Cruncher comes second, and Galen and Rydia return to the bookie to collect the winnings, getting six gold back, giving her a small profit.

  

Taking a second to take stock of the market, Galen and Rydia notice that most of the people here appear to hearders or involved with the dinosaur races in some way. There’s no obvious source of long distance transport, and certainly nothing that would get them far enough out of Gatherhold. The Lightning Rail is another option for leaving, but due to the rural nature of the town, it only runs occasionally, and isn’t due for another seven days. It also only runs north into [[Karrnath]]. 

With no obvious people to barter with for transport, Galen and Rydia head for the Salty Hag, the local tavern that smells faintly of fish, but serves decent ale. As they arrived, the place is packed, a lot of people there wearing ornate bone helmets, painted with dinosaur faces. This seems to be a large crowd from the races, and happily enough the drinks seem to be mainly free, as people keep putting down gold behind the bar and buying a round for everyone, the lack of silver in town leaving them with little other option. After a night of drinking and enjoying the atmosphere, the pair eventually leave, making their way back towards the Gold Dragon Inn and the comfort of their room.

As they walk through the streets of Gatherhold, in the distance, Galen spots an airship, descending over the town and eventually coming to a stop to the north of the town. It appears to be in bad shape, smoking as it flies past. Galen points this out to Rydia, who sighs and asks if Galen wants to go see if they need help. Galen says he doubts he’ll be of much help after a few drinks, and that wasn’t really what he meant anyway - it just might be a good way to get out of town, assuming the ship can still fly. He says he’s more than happy to wait until morning, and Rydia steps closer, smiling as she suggests they do exactly that, and have some fun in their room in the meantime. Galen asks if she’s sure, but she responds by strutting away, to which Galen repeats her earlier words, assuming he’s supposed to just enjoy this. She doesn’t answer, Galen eventually following her down the street. As they walk past the shores of Lake Cyre, they find the water glowing a luminescent blue, Rydia murmuring something about eyes as they walk by, before continuing back to the room. 

Waking fairly late in the morning, they find the glow from the water faded as the fog seems to have rolled in a little. In the distance, they can see the airship still there, docked over a crevasse. That part of town previously contained housing and other establishments, but was rumoured to be haunted by evil spirits, meaning most people have long since moved out. These days, it’s a good place for more seedy dealings. Pointing out they’re still in need of a way out of Gatherhold, Rydia says that whilst last night was fun, she needs a lot more than that to keep her entertained. Galen agrees, the two of them both expressing little desire to take the Lightning Rail, not exactly fond of the destination it would carry them towards, along with the wait. From what they’ve seen, the airship would be the best bet, so they agree to head over there and see if anyone’s around to talk to about possible transport.

Making their way through town, they head along the crevasse towards the ship, eventually finding a ladder that’s been dropped down from the side of the ship. Examining the ladder, Galen points out its a little hard to knock as Rydia asks if they want to use the concerned citizen card. Galen nods, pointing out they merely saw all the smoke and wanted to check if these people needed a hand. Climbing up the ladder, as they go, Rydia hears something moving about below deck, whilst Galen catches a glimpse of a brightly coloured feather. 

Climbing up, they find an orc standing on deck, who immediately asks what they’re doing there. Rydia explains they wanted to see if anyone needed some help up here, but the orc irately insists that he’s not in need of any assistance, and everything is fine. He asks them to leave, but Galen points out they’re merely trying to be helpful and there’s no need to be quite so aggressive. Before the debate can progress much further, a beautiful song echoes up from below deck, the melody instantly entrancing Galen, who moves across the deck, towards the open grate leading to the hold. Stumbling into the hold, the knock to the head as he falls in snaps him out of his entranced state, as Galen looks up to find a harpy at the end of the narrow hall, her feathers an array of bright colours. She flies directly at Galen, clawing at him on the ground, taking some deep gashes from the attack.

Meanwhile up on deck, the orc draws his sword and charges straight at Rydia, stabbing her with the blade. On suffering the wound, she darkly tells him “oh you shouldn’t have done that”, her skin and hair turning pale white, eyes red as the maw on her neck reappears, the orc stumbling back in fear at the sight. Damned moves forward, biting into the orc’s chest and shoulder, the acid burning through his skin as he screams out in pain. Knowing he’s taken on more than he bet on, the orc tries to run, but Damned manages to catch him before he can do so, killing him with a final blow from the maw. 

Meanwhile, still struggling with the harpy, Galen reaches for his pistol, unloading it into her at point blank range as he scrambles with the creature, before managing to slip away, hiding briefly in a storage room, which he finds contains about nine rusted warforged, as does one of the other rooms he can see through the open door. Realising her prey has escaped, the harpy starts to sing again, but when that fails to take hold she flies up through the grate, soaring above deck as she begins to try and get away. Realising the immediate danger is gone, Galen comes out of the storage room, climbing back towards deck as he takes a one handed shot from the ladder. The bullet hits home, ripping through one of her wings and sending her crashing to the deck, dead. Flecks of colour come off her wings as she lands, Galen realising they’ve been applied using paint.

Galen finishes climbing back out on deck, Damned managing to turn back into Rydia just as he emerges from the hold. She asks if he’s okay, and Galen assures her it’s nothing lasting. Noticing that she managed to handle the orc, he comments that she did well. Rydia asks what’s going on here, as the orc said everything was fine, but somehow there was a harpy below deck. Checking the harpy, Galen finds a small leather pouch containing 23 silver, a silver ring and a small silver dinner fork. There’s also a small satchel, which contains Dream Lily. Galen points out there was something about the silver in town going missing, but doesn’t understand why someone would paint a harpy and lock it in a ship, although Rydia theorises the harpy maybe painted herself. 

Rydia moves to check out the orc, mostly finding his weapons, although the two daggers he carries seem to have silvered tips. He also carries a small satchel, which has some fragrant sausage, likely used as rations for the road. Rydia doesn’t recognise the food, but takes it to use as ingredients at a later point, along with retrieving the two daggers. 

As they look around the deck, Galen hears a voice in his mind, “This is an official House Sivis announcement for Galen D’Arcy. Orryn Tullen would like to see you at the Salty Hag. End of message.” Galen relays this to Rydia, who points out they have an entire ship now. Galen knows they normally need someone of House Lyrandar to captain them, and points out they probably won’t be able to fly it anywhere on their own. Rydia says they don’t need to take it, but should probably take a look around before they head back. Galen agrees, heading to the Captain’s Quarters as Rydia explores the open deck. 

Galen finds the doors to the Captain’s Quarter’s locked, and makes short work of opening the lock with his thieves tools, carefully stepping inside. The room is well furnished, neatly arranged with a footlocker, a small desk and a table with a map of Khorvaire. There’s a large ledger on top of the desk, which Galen leafs through, finding a list of transactions, expenses and income laid out. The last income in the ledger was ‘Downpayment Harash delivery, 20 warforged, Gatherhold, 4th of Eyre, 700gp’. Realising the 4th of Eyre was yesterday, this makes the warforged Galen found in the hold all the more odd, as they’re still there. There’s also a distinctly larger number of expenses than incomes in the book. It seems they’ve had to spend a lot of money on fixing the ship lately. 

He also takes some time to go through the letters, finding communication from someone called Shivaro, who is writing to Fianin. There’s no last names on the letters, but Shivaro talks of the Khoravar community in Passage, saying that he misses her and wishes she would sample his hospitality more often. Knowing Khoravar is the term for half elf, Galen gathers they both seem to be half elven. Galen takes the time to leave everything how he found it, and then leaves the room, locking the door on his way out. 

Rejoining Rydia, she asks if he found anything, Galen relaying that it seems they were supposed to delivery warforged, and the ship is apparently in a poor state. That would explain the smoke from the night before, and Galen theorises that the orc wasn’t the captain, meaning they don’t know where the others are. Rydia points out they could search the rest of the ship, but Galen counters that they probably won’t find much else useful, and if they’re planning on hitching a ride, it would probably be good not to rifle through all their belongings. That said, the ship doesn’t appear to be in great shape, although they might not have a lot of options as far as leaving town goes.

Deciding their best bet is to see what Orryn wants, Galen points out they can come back when the rest of the crew are around if he doesn’t have anything useful. Rydia asks what they do about the bodies, the pair agreeing the concerned citizens card still works, given they were attacked for being perfectly nice to the guy and were merely defending themselves. Rydia agrees, pointing out the orc stabbed her with a sword. “So you stabbed him back?” Galen asks, which Rydia confirms before heading back towards the ladder and climbing back down towards Gatherhold. 

Making their way towards the Salty Hag, the town is preparing for a second day of races, the waters of Lake Cyre having lost their glow, lying murky and calm. The Salty Hag itself seems mostly abandoned, the only two clients at the moment being Orryn and Grek, who seem pleased when Galen and Rydia walk inside. Orryn stands, greeting Galen, noting that he brought his friend, who seems to be feeling much better. Rydia thanks him for his hospitality, Orryn saying its been no trouble as Galen’s been very useful with his work lately. Orryn comments he heard they were looking to leave, which they confirm, the bugbear asking if they were looking to head to Q’barra. He’s interested in funding an expedition, and knows there’s a temple there that they’re interested in. Orryn offers to fund transport and possibly some extra hands, for a percentage of the cut. 

He asks for a forty percent cut, and when Galen asks what the transport is, Orryn explains that Grek met the owners of the airship the night before. He says they’re interesting, apparently Cyrians, who he calls meticulous and perfectionists. Galen comments on the state of the ship, which Grek was assured was bad luck. Galen asks if they’re Lyrandars, but Grek says he didn’t see a dragonmark, although the Khorovar woman might have a Mark of the Storm hidden somewhere. Galen says the plan seems good, but challenges the forty percent cut, as it seems a little steep. Orryn agrees, but suggests that they don’t know anything about this airship crew. He could hire them at a flat rate, and get the investment back through them, if Galen helps them lowball the crew. Galen agrees it might be worth considering, right as the doors of the tavern open.

Four people walk in, the first a halfling with a small grey beard. He’s accompanied by two well armoured orcs, along with a massive ogre, pushing his way through the door. The halfling comments on the Jackdaws as the barkeep grows pale, telling them to keep things civil. The ogre throws down a ship’s anchor, piercing a hole through the floor with the impact. The halfling tells Grek that he’s to let the rest of his group know the Daask are running the harbour indefinitely, as the group start to come at Galen, Rydia, Orryn and Grek. 

Rydia looks towards Galen, murmuring “I’m sorry” before beginning to turn pale, the maw reappearing and widening before she walks towards the group of assailants. Tendrils erupt from the maw, battering the group, who all seem stunned in shock to see this. Damned then walks back towards Orryn, Galen and Grek, avoiding Galen’s gaze. Orryn recovers from the surprise of seeing this, clambering onto a table and striking one of the orcs with his morningstar. Galen, too busy staring at Damned to properly aim his shot, fires towards the halfling, but the shot goes wide, impacting the wall. Grek fires a guiding bolt at the ogre as the group begin to launch their attacks, the halfling leaping at Orryn as one of the orcs moves off to the side, tossing a table over as cover and taking a shot at Damned with his hand crossbow, as the ogre also rushes in to attack Damned, clearly affected by the sight of the maw.

Still avoiding Galen’s gaze, Damned bites at the ogre with the maw, the bite managing to heal some of her wounds a little as the teeth dig into the ogre’s flesh. Under attack from the halfling, Orryn hits at the halfling, whose rat like appearance has grown, the man appearing to be a wererat. The hit impacts, but the man seems unaffected by the blow. Meanwhile, Galen shakes himself out of staring at Damned, jumping onto one of the tables before taking a shot at the ogre, who’s distracted by Damned. The shot hits home, piercing something vital as the ogre cries out in pain, as Grek uses Sacred Flame to attack the ogre as well. Panicking at the assault, the ogre tosses the ship’s anchor at Galen, who’s knocked back from the impact of the heavy metal, as the ogre tries to claw Damned off of him.

Realising the halfling seems to be shrugging off the blows, Orryn takes care of the nearby orc, along with dealing with the already severely wounded ogre, both falling to the floor, dead. Orryn calls out for help with the wererat, which Galen says he can in a minute. He takes a shot at the orc hiding behind the table, the impact of the bullet killing him, before running over to take cover behind the same table, pushing the body out of the way. Seeing Galen’s wounded state, Grek joins him, using Cure Wounds to heal some of the injuries Galen took. 

Damned moves over to Orryn, passing him one of the silvered daggered they recovered from the airship, slipping up behind the halfling as the tendrils from the maw erupt and wrap around him, biting down and tearing a wound through him. Orryn attacks with the dagger Damned gave him, whilst Galen takes a shot at the halfling, although the bullet doesn’t seem to do much damage. Asking if Grek can do something, the goblin cackles before rushing in, hitting with a divine blow which blasts through the wererat, dealing the final blow.

Taking a second to catch their breath, Grek asks if Orryn’s okay, which he confirms he is. Orryn complains these guys keep coming, apologising for getting Galen and Damned mixed up in this. Galen moves over, breathing heavily as Orryn comments to Galen that it doesn’t seem like Damned is okay. “You have a problem with our results?” he asks, which Orryn quickly denies, saying they did well. “Then I wouldn’t complain about the methods.” Orryn goes quiet, Galen turning towards Damned, keeping his back to Orryn and Grek as he moves in close to her, speaking in a low voice. “We need to talk. Not here.” 

The barman is crouching behind the bar, seeming terrified and he mumbles about how he told them not to kill anyone. Galen retorts it’s hard not to kill people when they’re under attack, the barman pacing around as the door opens once more. Damned turns back into Rydia at this point, the vision of the adventurous brunette restored as a pale woman hovers in the door, floating towards the bar. Dressed in an elegant black dress, she wears a golden mask in the shape of a skull, and is wielding a massive golden scythe. She is followed by four pale men in grey and green uniforms, who begin collecting the bodies from the floor. The woman drops four bloodied golden coins to the barman, thanking him and saying it’s a pleasure doing business with him again. The barman shakily thanks her for the payment, as the woman turns to look at the group still standing in the Salty Hag. She then moves to the door, snapping her fingers as her men fall in behind her, dragging the bodies with them.

Rydia steps aside as they start to clean up, Galen keeping his eyes on her and turned away from the mysterious woman. Regardless, he can feel her gaze fall upon him for a moment before she exits the bar, the door falling closed behind them. After a moment, Orryn and Grek look around, before asking where the bodies went. Before they can answer, the door opens again, this time a new group arriving - a dark skinned half elven woman, two human looking men and a dwarf sized warforged stepping inside.
