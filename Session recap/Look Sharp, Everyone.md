# Look Sharp, Everyone
The following morning, over breakfast, both Petr and Rydia share what they learned in their dreams. Petr mentions a secret entrance that Fianin knew of that also leads down to Clawrift, known as Arthrathra’s gateway. It’s hidden away in the forest that was paid for by House Cannith. 

Rydia shares that Vvaraak indeed believes that what Yonhanna is trying to do will cause the Coming and that he was very adamant about them putting a stop to this. She also says he mentioned a specific date: Brightblade. This is in three days. 

There’s a discussion then, on what they should do. They consider talking to the warforged, unsure if that would take more time than they have. Rydia also shares the way into where Yonhanna was with the rest of the group, as she was the only one able to see where they were going as they were escorted down there.

The group agrees to go talk to the warforged, as they think the Lord of Blades and his people might be able to pose as a distraction as they try and find their way back inside Clawrift. They think that, in turn, they can offer themselves as a distraction as well, giving him and his people the upperhand in trying to rid Making of ‘flesh’. Beck does point out they won’t know how to find the crystal, suggesting that maybe there’s a way to use the crystal they have, to find the other crystal in Clawrift.

With this loosely agreed upon, they head back to the Order to meet up with Lina and Novac, who are busy packing for today’s trip. They confirm their plans with them, before Beck asks Lina if she knows of any way they can use one crystal to locate the other. She says she doesn’t know enough about the crystal they have in their possession, eventually casting Legend Lore on it to learn more.

As her spell takes, her eyes roll back and the crystal floats for a moment. Seconds later, she comes back to herself, telling Beck that he was on the right track with this idea. She tells the group that the crystals are connected, seemingly sharing a frequency. She goes on to say that, if they fail in finding the other crystal, they could use the one they already have to essentially interfere in the ritual. 

She asks the group if they know how to use the crystal, outside of just touching it, Galen assuring her that they have something for that. 

With Novac having gathered some explosives as well, Lina goes over the plan with everyone, confirming they intend to head to Making, collect their warforged friends and head to the warforged camp, where they will attempt to talk to the Lord of Blades. They also agree they will try to read the message on the note that Yonhanna said she wanted them to bring along. 

They will tell the warforged about the secret entrance through the gateway, hopefully convincing them to attack through that location and be a distraction as the crew themselves find their way back into Clawrift and hopefully locate the crystal. 

With the plan set, they teleport back to Making, where it instantly becomes clear there was a recent fight. The smell of gunpowder still lingers in the air, and Bonzo spots a large, hulking warforged near the inner walls of the city, moving away from here. 

They head down to meet up with Hilt and Scimitar, though Petr asks to take a look at the room below the teleportation circle, where the paste on his hand also glowed. He uses his hand as a guide as he goes through said room, noting that this place feels different from the larger rift downstairs. His hand shines brightest near a blip of silver on the floor.

Galen helps him take a look at things, deducing that the blip of silver seems to be a tip of some sort of conductor rod, the one they saw in the room downstairs as well. It seems to run from the larger rift down below, all the way up to here, meaning that the manifest zone they’re detecting here is the same one. 

As he looks at the position in which the planets in this room have frozen in place, Galen also figures out that whatever happened here, happened on the Day of Mourning. Meanwhile, Bonzo notes a strange shimmer in the room, realizing it’s a magical aura of sorts, which seems very unstable He warns the group against casting spells in this room, as well as in any other room where Petr’s hand lights up.

The group continues on after this, heading down to meet up with Hilt and Scimitar, who are waiting for them downstairs, letter from Yonhanna in hand. They start leading the way, guiding the group past the large park they saw, the same one what Fianin also mentioned to Petr.

The wind picks up as they move away from the city, crossing a glass plane that shows their own reflections as they look down, yet slightly distorted and strange. They note a massive shape on the horizon, a hulking figure made of bone, though it seems to be moving away. To be sure, the group detours around it and eventually they reach the end of this plane of glass.

This is where Hilt and Scimitar tell them they’ll go no further, pointing them ahead to where they need to go to find the camp. Beck deduces that they’re telling the truth when showing them the directions, and also notices that, the further they are away from the city, the more relaxed Hilt and Scimitar seem to have become. He tries to convince them to stay, or at the very least not go back to the city, but they refuse and eventually take their leave.

As Hilt and Scimitar move away from the group, they wait until they’re a little bit away until Beck takes the note from Yonhanna and dispels the magic on it. The note is addressed to Lauyas and Trezk, telling them that the ritual will take place in three days. Yonhanna is asking them to focus their psionic powers on the maze. “Stay strong, we’ll come and get you.” 

This prompts a discussion on the maze as well as the fact that the group heard Yonhanna say she was lying to these inspired. They eventually realize that she is likely telling them that she’s travelling back much further than she really intends to do; all the way back to before Dal’Quor got separated. She however, seems to only want to go back four years, to before the Mourning happened. 

Continuing onwards, they come upon a switchback road, following it down towards a mound in the distance that Hilt and Scimitar pointed out. As they’re heading down this path, the wind is picking up even more, and Beck becomes aware of cracks along the wall beside them that seem to be moving with them. 

He warns the others and soon three creatures emerge and a fight breaks out. Though one of the creatures attempts to steal Beck’s doorknob, the group manages to emerge victorious and retrieve the item, which also contains the crystal. They do deduce that this wasn’t a targeted attack; these creatures just like shiny objects and that one happened to be within reach.

Beck stows the doorknob away in a more secure place and they continue on their journey, eventually coming upon a walled compound, encircled by a ditch.  There are piles of corpses scattered around, though they are notably not all humanoid. Some of the bodies seem to be mutated, and some look like the creatures they just fought.

There’s a gatehouse at the far end of this compound, with guard towers around it as well. As they approach, Bonzo calls out to one of the guards, using Thaumaturgy so he’s heard over the wind. He tells them they come in peace and they have a common cause. The guard tell them ‘no funny business’, but do allow them to keep walking.

They approach the gatehouse, upon which three guards are stationed. Their weapons are drawn, but they’re not instantly attacking. Using Message so he’s better heard over the wind, Beck speaks to one of the guards, asking them if they can speak to the Lord of Blades, or someone else in charge, reiterating they have a common cause. 

They’re allowed inside, though they are asked to leave their weapons at the door. They agree to this and head in, which allows them a better view of the camp itself. There’s a large number of tents, as well as a pen to the side, which seems to contain a number of prisoners. They recognise the robes on two of them, quickly deducing those are likely Yonhanna’s inspired that got captured. There’s also a number of other humanoids, some of them covered in cancerous sores.

In the center of the camp is a large tent, with inside a large chair. There’s a massive warforged seated in it, with six arms and behind the chair there are blades, stuck into the ground. The large warforged is speaking to a smaller one, seemingly made entirely out of spare parts.

There’s a large, pyramid shaped crystal in the center of the room and as the group enters, Rydia’s maw closes, Beck no longer feels the mark on his shoulder and Galen’s hand seems to lose all magic as well. 

They head forward and are addressed by the large warforged, the Lord of Blades. Beck does the talking, explaining why they’re here, telling them they have a common cause and they think they might be able to help each other. 

The Lord of Blades talks about how Yonhanna and, more specifically, the Inspired, are keeping him and his people from repairing one of their greatest assets. Bonzo asks if he means the large warforged they saw, which the Lord confirms. This large warforged is immune to the Inspired’s psychic attacks, but he currently has no weapons. They also don’t have access to the Creation Forge that is located in Making. 

They talk to the Lord, asking him about his goals here. He says he wants to reclaim his land and when Bonzo asks him what that means, he confirms that it’s Cyre he’s talking about, with no plans of extending beyond that, at least for now. He goes on to say that the people of flesh still hold many of his brothers and sisters in bondage, which is something Bonzo seems to be aware of. 

At the suggestion of a peaceful approach, he says that they tried that and it didn’t work. Bonzo offers to look at the giant warforged they’re still trying to repair, Beck offering to help them with whatever they can here in Making. The Lord of Blades at the very least seems interested in talking about this.
