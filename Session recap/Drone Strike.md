# Drone Strike







Both Galen and Rydia see [[Akulele]], Petr, Beck and [[Sekkalok]] approach, all of them having spotted them in turn as well. [[Akulele]] tells Galen, who steps out, that she has his friends, who asks her if they’re going to have to get in a fight to get them back. She tells him not to worry, asking him if he’s alright.



Not quite trusting it, Galen asks her who she is, so she explains she’s made a deal with Beck. This conversation takes place in Draconic, so Beck jumps in as well, explaining the deal he made. “We have to help them with one thing, and they’ll help get us out and help us get us the keys.”



Urging them all to be quiet, [[Akulele]] says they should go upstairs, where they might be able to talk more freely. She leads them up the stairs, Galen, Rydia and Bonzo only just managing to hide in the staircase leading up as another black scale approaches [[Akulele]], asking her to explain what she’s doing and where she’s going.



As that black scale moves away, they all move up. The sun is low in the sky, elongated shadows indicating it’s much later in the day now. [[Akulele]] guides them all to the stables, where the human the group spotted before is still tied up.



Now that they’re somewhere safer, Akulele addresses the whole group. She explains to Beck and Petr that Jakzi, the one she wants them to deal with, was the one who spoke to her when they were moving upstairs. “So, I helped you, I’m going to need assurances that you’ll help me,” she continues, then asking if they’ll be willing to be target of a spell she can cast, just so she has assurances.



Though Beck doesn’t say no to this, he does ask about the keys and where they might be. Akulele says they’re in [[Korlasz]]’s room. Aware of the time pressure, considering Akulele wanted them to deal with Jakzi before Korlasz comes back, Beck suggests they should probably deal with this soon.



Listening to the conversation, Galen asks if they’re supposed to take care of a lieutenant of sorts, which Akulele confirms, explaining her plan to him. “Yes, Jakzi is the most driven, most corrupted by Masvirik. She is the one who will protest the loudest against someone with the Blood of the Protectors telling them how it is.”



There’s some confusion about the Blood of the Protectors, so she says she’s talking about Beck. “You are a shapechanger, no?” She goes on to explain that the Couatl who gave their lives to lock [[Masvirik]] in his tomb were also shapechangers, and that their blood is Beck’s blood.



“You did not know this?” she asks Beck, which he says he didn’t. The tale he heard from his parents was that changelings were created by the Traveller, to create a little more chaos in the world.



Beck asks for more information then, asking where they might be able to find Jakzi and whether or not she will be protected. Akulele says she’ll be in her room, near a fountain or bath filled with blood. She doesn’t leave that room much. She ponders for a moment, then tells the group about a secret entrance she’s aware of.



“Hidden underneath a lot of leaves, there’s an entrance to the underside of the barracks that will lead into a larger workshop, near a murder corridor, where you could surprise her.” She adds that the murder corridor is usually abandoned, so they shouldn’t have to worry too much about getting attacked there.



It should be easier to reach Jakzi via that way, as that place is also not very well guarded. That’s also near Akulele’s own workshop, so Sekkalok can offer backup for the group. “And after that, what is it you want me to tell people?” Beck then asks. Akulele says she wants him to use his most plane state, ‘the one with the white face’. If he can talk to the black scales like that and tell them that they’re destroying the very things they were put on this earth to guard, she’s quite sure they can get a lot of them on their side.



Khorvash wishes to awaken the Cold Sun, and keep corrupting the jungle, which is something that doesn’t sound very good to the group either. Beck then asks Akulele to give them a moment to discuss.



As most of their conversation was in draconic, Bonzo asks what they’re meant to do and why, which Beck attempts to explain. There’s question of whether or not they can trust Akulele, but considering she did just walk them all out, they agree to give her the benefit of the doubt for the time being. Galen quickly checks in with everyone, Bonzo, Petr and Beck saying that they are.



“You know you got eaten by a wall?” Galen points out to Beck, which he denies, as he doesn’t remember that happening. He says clearly he’s just having a good day, as he also just found out he has some sort of ancient blood in him, so things can’t get better. “Well you say that, but I’ve never been more happy to see you all here, conscious, so..” Galen says, as things could clearly be worse.



Rydia suggests that temporary insanity is a good way to handle processing a lot of information at once, though Beck points out Galen might not be okay with that. “I think we’ll be alright, we just need some time to process and we don’t have that right now.” They decide all they have to do for now is take care of Jakzi, though Bonzo questions how easy that’s going to be.



During this conversation, Rydia takes out her water skin, approaching the man who’s tied up. She gives him some water, which he’s grateful of, though her appearance is unsettling to him. She briefly speaks to the man, but she’s soon interrupted by Akulele, who hears someone approaching and urges the group to stay down.



All of them can hear marching sounds approaching, potentially indicating that the blackscale patrol they lured out before might be b[\[b\]](#cmnt2)ack. They eventually hear a low gravelly voice, which Beck recognises as the captain who was with Korlasz’s group when he ran into them. He speaks to Akulele; form the conversation Beck and Galen can gather that they’ve captured the dragonborn guardians. “Give these two to Emrath and bind the leader in the stable. After she is sufficiently weakened from malnourishment, we’ll have her hammer her former colleagues to dust.”



Hanging back still, Petr conjures up some goodberries, sharing them with the group as well as the older human that was tied up. Realising that the captain was talking about bringing [[Nerima]] into the stables, Beck suggests they hide. He and Petr decide to stay with Akulele, as they are supposed to be under her spell anyway, and Galen, Rydia and Bonzo look for a hiding place.



The former two climb up into the rafters of the stables as Bonzo attempts to hide behind a wooden column, making himself as small as possible. Soon after, two black scales move in, carrying Nerima, with chains around her wrists and ankles that they fasten to a pole in the stables.



They don’t give Petr and Beck too much attention, but they also spot Bonzo, which Petr notices, promptly falling flat onto his face in an attempt to distract the black scales. One of them comments on Bonzo not having yellow musk, picking Bonzo up and noting how he seems very much alive.



He tosses Bonzo against the back wall, Beck quickly casting Feather Fall to try and lessen the blow, managing to do so without the black scales noticing. Akulele quickly interjects then, telling the other black scales she’s working on a new sort of experiment, which means she doesn’t need the flower. “He has been doused in blood of the Couatl, I’m trying to make them a bit more hardier for when they have to go into the tar pit.”



They call her a crazy bitch, but still take their leave, telling their captain that the shaman is just doing something strange. Beck and Petr notice that many of these black scales seem very, very wounded, so it’s not surprising when Akulele is asked for healing magic, following the black scales out of the stables.



This leaves the group alone in the stables with the human male as well as Nerima, who Beck is quick to check up on. She’s badly wounded, stripped of weapons and armor and chained. Beck asks Bonzo to take a look at the chains, as he’s better at those things, as Petr walks up to Nerima, healing some of her wounds.



During all that, Rydia and Galen could hear most of the conversations going on from where they were hidden, or at least, Galen could, as he understands draconic as well. Rydia telepathically speaks to Galen, saying she feels like she should apologise. “I wanted to.. I didn’t want to when it happened, but I did it anyway, and now I… feel conflicted between this new information and the thing that happened. What I did.”



“Conflicted how?” Galen asks, to which Rydia says she thinks she should feel terrible about what she did, but at the same time Vvarraak said something that made her think this was necessary. He said she has a purpose. “It helps to know, this wasn’t random chance. It’s still terrible to remember… I remember what our friends tasted like, I want you to know that.” She repeats that she’s conflicted.



When Galen asks if she meant to do it, she says no. “I saw things, for centuries. I hadn’t eaten in centuries, so hungry when I came back. I don’t think I wanted to, but there was nothing else.”



“Why stop at me?” Galen asks, which Rydia tries to remember, but she can’t recall. She then points out she thinks she can hear the others talking, so Galen says they can continue talking about this later, after this all has been dealt with. “I’m still not going anywhere.”



Meanwhile, Petr explains to Nerima that they’re not actually under Akulele’s charm and that they’re helping her, telling her some more of the situation. Nerima doesn’t seem very happy about them working with one of the black scales, as she’s been burned by a similar situation before.



“Did you hear what they said? They were going to .. feed my fellow soldiers to something,” Nerima then asks, the others confirming they did hear and Beck suggesting they might still be able to stop that. “Feed them to what though..” Bonzo says, but none of the group really know what this Emrath creature was that was mentioned. “We better hurry then.”



Bonzo frees Nerima by picking the lock on her chains, and he also gives her his pipe wrench, so she has a weapon to use. He also gives her a shield, seeing as her armor was stripped of her as well.



The human joins the conversation as well, introducing himself as Orvex. He thanks the group for their aid, Rydia in particular, offering to help if there’s anything he can do. “I’m not a very good fighter, but I do know my way around the draconic language and script.”



Beck asks him why he’s here, to which he says he was taken from an expedition from House Tharashk. They were jumped in the night by the black scales. When Bonzo asks him what they were doing here, to which Orvex says that the black scales kept asking him about the [[Poison Dusk]].



He doesn’t necessarily know his way around, but he does know there’s a dark dungeon underneath the main building. “They dipped my head into some foul, thick liquid.. it smelled like death. Otherwise, I’ve no idea where I’ve been.” Beck checks to see if he has a crystal in his eye, but can’t really see.



Rydia hoists Galen over her shoulder and the two of them climb back down, joining the others. Nerima seems anxious for action, wanting to go after her teammates, but the others try to at least come up with some sort of plan before they start moving. They agree they should try and find the secret entrance and move in through that, but before they leave, Beck turns to Orvex, curious if he intends on coming with them.



They agree that Orvex instead will hide in a building he spotted outside, covered in vines and graffiti, and they’ll come find him after they’re done here. He’s given a boost up over the wall and then moves away from the group.



Galen suggests that he go out and find the secret entrance. Rydia hoists him up so he can climb up and onto the building, and he starts scanning the surroundings. He doesn’t spot anything on the side he’s on, but when he checks the west side of the building he notices something that could be the secret entrance.



Sneaking closer, he follows footsteps in the dirt to where they suddenly stop, moving leaves and foliage aside to unearth a damp and narrow staircase heading down. It looks very chaotic, possible a hastily added escape path. Galen covers it back up, then sneaks back to join the others again.



He tells them what he found, and they devise a plan on how to best get to the secret entrance, Galen noting that it’s in clear view from the black scale that’s posted in the tower. They eventually decide to try and sneak there, with Beck making himself look like Akulele, just in case they get noticed and he has to try and talk the guard into still letting them pass.



Galen takes the lead, managing to sneak ahead, but Rydia, who goes right after him, trips and falls over, which the guard in the tower notices. Beck quickly walks out, pretending to be Akulele, ‘fussing’ over Rydia. The guard asks ‘Akulele’ if she’s okay, to which Beck explains some of the drones have healing and he’s taking them downstairs. He looks confused, but seems to shrug it off, so Beck gestures for the others to follow, all of them making their way towards the secret entrance.



They go inside, Galen leading the way again as the others file in behind him, the tunnel only wide enough for one person at a time. They wind up in what looks like a workshop of sorts, where Galen spots Sekkalok, as well as another black scale and a large, bug-like creature; an umberhulk. Galen hears the black scale talk to the creature, calling it Otto. Otto seems to spot Galen, but he manages to duck back into the tunnel.



The group huddles in the tunnel as they briefly discuss what to do, before Galen picks up a pebble from the ground, throwing it at [[Sekkalok]] to alert him to their presence. Though he knows something is up, he doesn’t quite see them, so Beck then simply walks out, still looking like Akulele.



Reasonably assuming the other black scale is in charge of the umberhulk, Beck asks him to call off the creature, as she doesn’t want it to eat her experiments. He does so, luring Otto away from the others with some insects, having him crawl back into a hole at the far end of the room. With the umberhulk away, Beck gestures for the others to follow him out of the entrance.



Sekkalok notices his ‘mother’ doesn’t quite sound as she usually does, so Beck whispers to him, explaining he’s not his mother, he’s one of the people his mother made a deal with. He seems somewhat confused, but does accept this explanation, then asking if they need guidance. He says he doesn’t think the other black scale is going to be a problem, so Beck then asks him to guide them to where Jakzi is.



He starts guiding them through a door, into the murder corridor that Akulele described earlier. They move through it, noticing shadows behind the wall, indicating that there do seem to be people on the other side of the arrow slits in the corridor. Sekkalok then opens the door to a large chamber that’s dimly lit by a number of torches.



The torches are wielded by a couple of lizardfolk, who are standing on the other side of a massive round pool. A larger black scale is petting her pet triceratops on the other side of the pool as well, whispering incantations of doom and corruption into the creature’s ear. As the group enters, this black scale recognises Akulele and Sekkalok, addressing them. The rest of the group hangs back in the hallway, trying to somewhat stay out of sight.



“I was hoping to have a word with you in private,” Beck offers. “It concerns Korlasz, it’s a sensitive matter.” She seems hesitant, but eventually tells the other black scales in the room to leave, making her way over towards where Akulele and Sekkalok are. She says she hopes this is enough, assuring Beck that her pet won’t do anyone any harm.



When she asks about the lack of yellow musk on the people she can see in the hallway, Beck tells her it’s an experiment, and he doesn’t need the yellow musk anymore for her experiments. He offers to demonstrate, but she doesn’t seem interested. “What did you want to talk about?,” she then asks, and after quickly looking over at Sekkalok, Beck goes to answer her question before he casts Silence on Jakzi.



This signals the beginning of combat, the rest of the group quickly moving into the room and going straight for Jakzi, who is momentarily blocked from calling for help because of the Silence spell. Galen asks Sekkalok to block the door that they saw the other black scales leave through, so he starts making his way over there as the rest focuses on Jakzi.



Beck’s silence doesn’t last long, but does provide the group ample opportunity to hurt Jakzi, who then does manage to call for help. Her back up runs right into [[Sekkalok]], who manages to hold both of them off, and Rydia then manages to capture some of them as well as the pet triceratops in her Hunger of Hadar spell.



They eventually manage to kill Jakzi, as well as the triceratops and with the two of them dealt with, Galen urges Beck to do as Akulele suggested; drop his disguise and revert to his base form. As soon as he does this, some of the remaining black scales look up, instantly seeming to notice this.



The others have never seen Beck like this; an amorphous humanoid, with no clear gender, some sort of stand-in form for something else. The black scales that don’t seem to care about this are soon dealt with, one dropping right before Beck’s feet as they attack anyway, getting blasted by Rydia, Petr and Bonzo.



In draconic, Beck calls out to the remaining black scales, telling them to drop their weapons so they can resolve this peacefully. The three already staring at him drop their weapons, Sekkalok deals with the one near him who doesn’t, which means that combat, for now, is over.



And Beck, has gained the audience of a couple of very enchanted lizardfolk.
