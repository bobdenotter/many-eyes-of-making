# My Beloved Monster and Me
The sound rings in combat, the crew finding themselves spread across the three levels of the ship. Rydia, Beck and Petr all three are met with sights that scare them: Petr sees Rydia change again into a monstrous tentacles creature as in turn, Rydia sees Petr point his staff at her, yelling that she doesn’t belong here. Beck, at the top deck of the ship, sees a large hand appear, putting the man in black who hunted them in Gatherhold not too long ago on deck. The figure draws a rifle and points it at him saying "You're captain now, big boy".

Meanwhile, Bonzo sees a creature emerge through the door behind Rydia, as down below, Galen is still stunned and unable to move. What follows is a messy combat, with tentacles soon appearing from below the ship, wrapping around it and pulling it down, causing cracks to appear in the lower hold and creatures to climb in through said cracks. 

Bonzo and Rydia do their best to deal with the mindflayer and a mindwitness that appear as Beck soon jumps all the way to the lower deck to help out Galen and Petr. Rydia is left stunned and both she and Bonzo are slowed by this mindflayer and mindwitness. As the creature below the ship continues pulling it down, they only barely make their escape. Beck grabs the box of Saan’s belongings and Dimension Doors onto the ship, only to leave the box there and jump right back down to help the others. From atop, he gets a bit of a better look at the creature below the waves, seeing rows of glowing red eyes as large tentacles continue destroying the ship. 

Petr manages to make his way outside by wildshaping into a goldfish as Bonzo uses a spell to teleport the thankfully no longer stunned Rydia onto the underside of the Heritage, where she’s able to latch on with her tentacles. Everyone else is able to grab hold of the rope ladder dangling from the ship and as the Emperor is dragged down to the depths of the sea, they find their way back up to the deck of the Heritage, bruised and battered but still alive. 

As they climb back onto the deck, they spot Saan, going through the box of his belongings, seemingly particularly interested in a statue that’s inside. It looks like a statue of an angel, with vines around the neck as well as ankles, but Saan quickly puts it away as soon as he notices the crew is back aboard. 

They ask him if they found what he was looking for, which Saan confirms, thanking them sincerely. He starts writing them a check, promising they can cash that in at a bank at a later time. As they check in with each other, Bonzo asks what that down there was. None of them really know much about what those creatures were, nor what their interest in that ship was, though Saan seems to know more. 

Bonzo and Beck do know of rumors they’ve heard of purple skinned tentacle creatures, but know nothing much outside of that. Saan at first pretends he doesn’t know much more, ignoring Bonzo’s question about it and simply handing the check to Beck, saying it’s about ten thousand gold. Bonzo urges him to answer his question, repeating it and Saan soon relents, sharing the truth. 

“I shouldn’t, but … all of you risked your lives and … well, screw it.” He goes on to explain he used to own a bunch of mines in the [[Greywall Mountains]]. One of them contained a strange place. “I’ve been there myself; my prospectors told me I should really see it with my own eyes. It was some strange altar down in the mine.” Carved ruins, it seemed very old and they had no idea what it was.

“When we were inspecting it we were confronted by a group of orcs. They told me it was a gateway, something that we should keep shut at all times, because creatures like those below are behind it.” He goes on to say that they gave him a key to keep safe and he thinks maybe that’s what these creatures were after. Beck asks if the statue is the key, which Saan confirms. 

They continue discussing this for a moment, none of them sure where these creatures came from. Saan seems to genuinely not know how they found the ship or how they knew what was being transported on it. He adds that this is why he didn’t deposit his things into a bank; he’s been to the Mror Holds and has seen people fight these creatures, it was the main reason he wanted to use his own transportation. “I don’t trust anyone, I’m very paranoid like that.” 

Bonzo points out that in this case, that seems justified, before thanking Saan for the sizable reward he just gave them. They discuss where to go next, soon setting course to [[Adder Port]] where they promised to drop off Saan. He says that from there, he will make his way to King Sebastis’ court, claim his land and start his new adventure in Q’barra. 

On their way to Adder Port, Saan packs up his things and writes Beck a note, handing it to him. “I have some good friends in Sharn, the Laisha family. They are, like me, well off, and ..” He goes on to describe them, but Beck recognises the name. They were weapons manufacturors for the previous crown and worked together with House Cannith a lot in the past. They’ve since moved away from that to make other stuff. “[[Ervalt Laisha]] is the patriarch of the house, he’s an honorably man. He can definitely get you work in the city if you need it, and has some pull with the council of the city.”

Beck also knows that the Laisha family are not necessarily on good terms with the Canniths anymore, though they are still cordial towards them. 

They soon arrive in Adder Port. It’s a small city, with a large fort and a small dock, consisting out of maybe 100 houses that all seem to be built in Cyrian architectural style. They pull into the harbor, lower the ship and drop off Saan. Saan shakes all of their hands, wishing them much luck on their future endeavors, a sentiment they return before saying their good-byes.

Soon after, they set course for Sharn. 

The first day of travel is largely uneventful. On the second day, Petr takes the time to write a letter to the Gatekeepers.

“*Dear Gatekeepers,

*It is me, your friend Petr. I am writing you today to let you know my findings regarding Rydia, as you’ve asked me to do. My apologies for not writing any sooner, I have not had any opportunity to do so at an earlier time. As it happens, we’ve been in turmoil of events since I’ve rejoined the group after we last met. Most recently we were in Haka’torvak, where we barely managed to escape with our lives. 

*Anyhow, about Rydia. It is true that she is an enigma, but as I’ve now spent more time around her, I’m convinced that she is not what you fear. She might be corrupted by her involuntary interaction with the Tome of Vvaraak, but I’m convinced she is not inherently evil, nor did she seek out this corruption herself.

*In fact, we’ve been actively working together to find a way to untangle this whole shitstorm. I will let you know more at a later time, because we’re still in the dark ourselves, so to say. During our travels we did meet up some of these Emerald Claw folks, and while I’m not certain of their motives just yet, I am confident that we best stay clear of them as best as possible.

*We are currently travelling to Sharn hoping to find more answers. From now on I will make sure to keep you updated in a more timely fashion.

*Greetings, 

*Petr Petrson IV

*Also please give my warmest regards to Thom if he is still there with you.

*PS. I am still grateful for the wonderful staff I’ve been given, it excellent for clobbering foes with. 

*PPS. I am aware we did not really discuss this when we previously met, but I have been keeping receipts of all necessary expenses. I’m sure the Gatekeepers’ bookkeeper will appreciate this. Haha see what I did there?”

After he finishes writing the note, he notices a drawing on his door of what looks to be a zombie Azaka. There’s text underneath, that says “I know what you did in Newthrone.” He takes note of it, but doesn’t do anything else with it. The second day goes by without much hassle. 

Travel continues, and on one of the following days Galen finds himself on the deck as he notices a massive airship glide overhead. As he looks around, he realises they’re passing through a collection of airships that all hang above a seemingly small settlement. There’s dessert all around, with a massive piece of red dessert rock sticking out with some buildings on top of it. There’s a gleaming white airship dock above it all. 

Petr recognises this as [[Taer Shantara]]. Most of the airships seem to be here to help with construction on that gleaming white building on the red rock. There’s large cacti dotted around the landscape in and around the buildings, with taps inside them that seem to be used for irrigation throughout the city. 

The city itself seems fairly new as a whole and Petr and Beck recall Fianin mentioning this place. She never wanted to go, because she hated Valenar elves. Taer Shantara is a new city that house Lyrandar is building for themselves and all the Khorvar in Eberron; a city for half-elves. 

As they’re flying by, Galen comments on the size of the Heritage compared to the others, saying the bigger ones was kind of what he’d expected. 

That evening, Rydia is in the kitchen, preparing dinner. Every time she stirs a pot, she hears a cricket. Putting her things down, Rydia steps outside of the kitchen before casting Hunger of Hadar in it. As she heads back inside soon after, she picks up where she left up, but the sound is still there.

She switches to using another spoon, which doesn’t seem to make the sound, so she quickly deduces it’s the spoon she was using. Not wanting to waste time on this, she simply throws that spoon overboard. Down below, a group of Valenar elves is rushing along the dessert, their chief suddenly getting hit in the head with a wooden spoon. She then gets back to work on warming dinner.

The following day is quiet, the heat of the dessert still palpable and they soon make their way out of Valenor. This means they approach the mists of the Mournland, climbing over them. Beck’s quiet as they pass over them, seeing faces in the mist, a painful reminder of what happened to his homeland. 

Roughly six or seven days into the trip, they clear the Mournland airspace and from atop the deck, Petr spots a number of large birds seemingly having an aerial fight over the remains of a massive boar. Petr recognises these birds as dragon hawks, never having seen them in person before. He takes a mental note for future wild shape purposes. 

That night, as Galen retreats for the night, he finds that his pillow is snoring. He quickly deduces that it seems to be some sort of magical trick, popping his head out of his room and calling out: “Is someone really bored?” 

Rydia responds, heading down to see what Galen is talking about. He tosses the pillow to Rydia so she can see what he’s talking about. “Have I told you about the spoon?” Rydia asks, Galen saying she did mention that, the two of them agreeing that it seems similar. They theorize whether or not someone aboard the ship might be this bored, figuring that all three of the other crew members might be able to do something like this. 

This is when Rydia suggests they read the others’ minds to figure out who did this, Galen agreeing, because why not. He then suggests they start with Bonzo, deciding he’s the most likely suspect. 

Rydia goes to find Bonzo, Galen waiting back in the hallway as she addresses him, explaining the situation to him. “I’m trying to find out who’s been making things make noise and you’re the most likely suspect, so I’d like to read your mind. Are you going to resist or are we going to do this the easy way?” Bonzo asks her to first explain what’s been happening, to which Rydia elaborates by saying her spoon and Galen’s pillow have been making noise. 

With her Detect Thoughts, Rydia soon picks up on some guilt about tricking people, easily figuring out that it was indeed Bonzo who’s been pranking people. Bonzo at first says it wasn’t him, then points out she’s not laughing. “I mean, I was trying to make a joke,” Bonzo explains, Rydia pointing out she threw out her favorite spoon because of him. She then turns around, telling Galen he was right, so Galen joins the conversation.

“I wanted to lighten up the mood a bit around the ship after recent events,” Bonzo admits, demonstrating how he can make a number of items make all sorts of noise. Rydia points out it’s endearing, applauding his effort. Galen says that Bonzo touching something from the kitchen was a bold move, before wishing Bonzo good night.

Bonzo says he can remove the spell from the pillow, which comes flying at his head about ten seconds later. He catches it, removing the spell and throwing it back, Rydia now amused by the situation moreso than Bonzo’s pranks. Rydia compliments’ Bonzo’s reflexes, who says he feels much better since they left Haka’torvak.

This turns the conversation to how both Haka’torvak and the Emperor weren’t fun places to be at, Rydia saying they should do something easy when they get to Sharn, to balance out all the terrible things from before. She suggests helping an old lady, which turns into helping out at a food shelter and that somehow turns to Bonzo suggesting he can make a porridge machine. 

Beck and Petr join the conversation, having taken note of something going on. The others share their porridge machine plans, and the plan behind it all that they want to do something nice for a change. “Everything sucks and they want to do something nice,” Galen summarises, Bonzo explaining how that went from feeding an old lady to a porridge machine. “I just want to do something nice that doesn’t involve too many tentacles,” Rydia points out. 

As everyone then goes to retreat for the night, Bonzo continues scribbling away on his porridge machine device as Galen asks Rydia if they can talk in private. 

The two of them move to their bunk to talk. “There are some people I need to see when we get there, and I want you to meet them,” Galen starts. He goes on to say that his parents aren’t aware of the full extent of what he does and he doesn’t want to scare them. He trails off, asking Rydia if she knows what he’s trying to say. “Keep the mask on,” Rydia says, to which Galen shakes his head, instead saying he just wants it to be her decision.

“I’m just warning you that they might not understand, and I wanted to warn you.” Rydia says she’s still getting used to everything herself, but she’s getting comfortable around Galen about it. “I know it’s … I still think Bonzo has the right of it.” Galen agrees, saying he thinks maybe he does, which causes Rydia to promptly walk away. 

Galen calls after her, saying he didn’t mean it like that, following her up on the deck of the ship. “I didn’t mean it like that,” he says, Rydia asking him to explain what he did mean then. “I meant that sometimes it feels like I’m losing my mind, and that’s not you.” Rydia asks him to elaborate. “I am haunted by dreams that don’t make any sense. And past mistakes and decisions that I can’t get rid of. And all of it, all of this shit is because of my own fucking mess. And sometimes I feel like the last few years never happened and I must’ve made it up. But then I know that can’t be true, because I never would’ve invented someone as good as you.” 

Rydia thanks him, commenting on how that was very subtle. “Some of the old Galen I know.” She goes on to say she followed him for a reason. “You weren’t the first smooth-talking handsome face to walk into the inn. You were the first to convince me to come with. And the only one.” Galen asks her if she regrets it and Rydia goes to say that she doesn’t. “I have, for a while,” she corrects herself. “But not anymore.” 

Asking her what changed, Rydia responds with “us”. She says that she feels like they haven’t been this close since they met, Galen adding that it’s not like it used to be. “But you and I are closer,” Rydia reiterates. She adds that she’s not happy about what happened to her per say, Galen saying he wouldn’t expect her to be. “But I’m not sure either of us can go back,” he adds. Rydia says that she feels like she’s been more useful to what Galen is doing, to which Galen says she didn’t need her to be useful, correcting himself by saying she was always useful. “I didn’t want you to come with me, because I needed you to do something, I wanted you to come with me because I liked you.”

“And that’s why I joined you, and that’s why you should stop feeling like you’re carrying all of the guilt. I chose to come with you,” Rydia responds. She adds that he has a lot to be concerned about, concerning everything that’s going on. “And so do I. So let’s just agree that we’re in this together. And if we both turn out to be … well, at least we’ll be monsters together.” Galen says he thinks he’d like that. 

Galen then apologises for not being very good at saying the right thing, Rydia pointing out that only seems to be the case when he’s being honest. “When you’re trying to get under my skirt, it’s a different story …” This brings the converation to Rydia’s father, who called Galen a silver-tongued devil multiple times. “We’re not going to see your parents anytime soon, are we?” Galen asks, which Rydia says would be weird before saying she did get a response from them. 

When asked, she elaborates that they said they understand. “And I just wanted you to know that… my parents might not,” Galen says, bringing the conversation back to what he was trying to say before. “But I don’t care what they say. Nothing they can do or say will change anything between us.” Rydia says she’ll keep the mask on, Galen saying that’s not what he’s asking her to do. “I’m warning you that they won’t get it, but what you want to do is up to you.” Rydia concludes she’ll still keep the mask on, and if they push it, she will grant their request. She then adds that maybe she should avoid giving Galen’s parents details, as she didn’t give her parents details either. 

Galen then excuses himself, but Rydia soon follows, finding a bottle from the kitchen before they retreat to their room. 

As they move further away from the Mournland the following day, the airship is gliding over Darguun with very little light around the airship. From atop the deck, Beck can still see the wall of clouds behind them as strange lights from the stratosphere bounce of the mists, illuminating the lands of Darguun in violet light.

It’s dark out and in the distance, slightly obscured by the mists of the Mournland, Beck sees the vague shapes and contours of a Cyrian city called [[Whiteheart]]. A narrow city, built up into the sky; there’s the skeletal wreckage of buildings and houses. There, he sees a large central temple of Olladra, strangely still intact amidst this cemetery of ruined buildings. 

He visited this temple once before, knowing it’s built on an overlook of the entire city. The overlook itself is a large shard of glass coming out of the ground, and the temple looks like it’s floating above the city proper. There used to be a statue of a woman with her hand up, and an illusion programmed into it as if she’s throwing dice into the air.

Taking a moment, Beck takes out the deck of cards from his wife, drawing one; his attempt at a prayer. He pulls an upside down Temperance card, which means imbalance, excess, self-healing and re-alignment. He takes this as a good sign, finishing his watch before retreating to bed.  

On their last day of travel, Rydia spots a particularly large goose, shooting it down from the sky and preparing that for dinner that night; a last great meal before they reach their destination.   

As the last day of travel concludes, roughly around dusk, they start gliding into the City of Towers. They can see an orange glow that covers the top of Lyrander Tower as the sun sinks into the sky. Near them, the great air ships of House Lyrander float like leviathan surrounded by brilliant rings of energy. 

Below they can see a criss cross of bridges, connecting the many towers of the city. The sounds of the city meet their ears; a unique mesh of airships, children playing and many more that indicates they’ve arrived in Sharn.**
