# Croak & Dagger

The captain of the guard seems to be particularly taken aback by this whole situation as, looking around, the crew is relatively quick to realise that these guards in general don’t tend to see a lot of action. They seem hesitant to pick a fight and considering the crew isn’t interested in that either, Bonzo and Lux take the lead in attempting to calm the situation down, defending Rydia and telling the guards she simply has a condition. 

Noting the lieutenant seems a little calmer than the captain, who is by now yelling about what’s going on, Rydia approaches him after quickly checking in with Galen about what just happened. As she steps away from the captain, he swipes at her, but misses, his sword clattering to the ground. Rydia holds her hands out to the lieutenant, saying he’s welcome to arrest her if she actually did anything wrong, before using her telekineses to move the sword back over to the captain, mentally telling him he should be more careful with his things. 

After the warforged peacekeeper intervenes as well, his gas manages to calm down the captain (though thankfully not affecting any of the crew) and they’re eventually let off with a warning, the lieutenant advising Rydia that she should probably cover up more. 

With the situation largely resolved, the crew wastes no time in finding their way towards Lyrander tower and taking the elevator up to the berth where their ship is stationed. Recalling something [[Esme]] said over dinner, Lux sets to work on looking into enabling some illusion magic that will allow the crew more of a view over the city and once Galen has found some wine, they all reconvene aboard the deck of the ship. 

Rydia first casts Sending, reaching out to [[Vvaraak]]. She tells him no one came, she’s still pretty sure he’s wrong and tells him his timing needs work. Vvaraak responds, saying it appears Rydia’s mind isn’t that broken after all. “I’ll work on my timing, even though it’s all irrelevant.” Rydia comments on how at least there’s someone who’s more insane than she is.

Then, she shares what happened, telling the others that she was back in Vvaraak’s cave and he spoke to her. He wants to send her on a path but he doesn’t want her to know why, because she can’t ‘handle’ things. Petr points out it’s strange that he can’t tell her what she’s supposed to do, but she is apparently supposed to do it regardless. “Didn’t even look at it that way, good point,” Rydia says. 

He also mentioned the Coming again, them needing the eyes to stop it. “And here’s where it gets a little bit concerning: so he can remake the world.” The crew agrees that this doesn’t sound good. Rydia then describes what Vvaraak looked like, detailing the scaleless skin and the dragonmarks that seemed to have been carved into said skin. When Lux asks, Rydia offers that none of the dragonmarks seemed recognisable, so none of them were of any of the dragonmarked houses. 

Lux tries to recall whether or not dragonmarks on dragons is a regular occurrence; as far as she knows it isn’t. Dragons tend to not have dragonmarks; they appeared on mortal races specifically. The dragonmarks are tied to the draconic prophecy; a physical manifestation of the prophecy on the flesh. The fact that Vvaraak’s marks seemed to be cut into his skin also seems odd. 

“Sentinels of the Maze,” Rydia then says, Lux linking the maze to Xoriat, as that’s where both she and Rydia saw it. They seem to be related to or are in fact ‘the Coming’. “So he wants us to get the eyes to stop them, but you don’t believe him anymore?” Galen summarises, Rydia saying that Vvaraak said her brain was a soup. “By brain isn’t a soup, is it?” Both Galen and Lux tell her it isn’t. 

They discuss what to do with this information. Rydia adds that they don’t need all of the Eyes; three out of five would be enough. They talk about what this means for the group, whether or not they want to keep looking for them. Petr points out it seems there’s now more urgency to finding these, Galen pointing out he knows of at least two other people who are trying to find them. 

Lux points out they don’t know what finding the Eyes will lead to, though she agrees it seems better that they’ll have them as opposed to other parties. She does suggest they still try and find Zenobaal, as they might have more information. 

They agree to keep going, Galen then saying he thinks they should go to Making. They were all considering that already, though Galen says he’s very much not looking forward to going into the Mournland. There’s an Eye there though, so it’s worth the risk. “Besides, what’s the worst that can happen?” Rydia saying, Galen asking her why she would say that.

Lux reminds them all that means they need funding, materials, and to pass a test. “If we don’t go … I’ve been staring at that prophecy for weeks, and I don’t know where the others are,” Galen says, Lux pointing out she hopes that Zenobaal will be able to help with that. “Can I make things slightly worse? Vvaraak said not to trust the prophecy,” Rydia adds. 

They’re not sure what that means, especially considering the fact that as far as they know, this was Vvaraak’s prophecy. Galen theorizes it might mean that Vvaraak is telling them not to trust the other dragons. He then ponders on why people would be seeking these items out if Vvaraak’s just spouting nonsense, Lux suggesting they’re powerful items so people want to use them regardless. 

Bonzo questions whether or not it would be a good thing for them to have all that power in one spot, but though the others agree he has a point, they only have one so far, and they still think the Eyes will be in better hands with them than with anyone else. They discuss this for a moment, Lux pointing out that one of the Eyes is already in a hard-to-get-to spot when the subject of dropping one to the bottom of the ocean comes up. 

Considering people might know where the one in Making is, they still agree to go get it. If they can find a way to get to it, others might find ways as well. “We might want to beat them to it,” Bonzo says. They agree to keep looking for the eyes, as Rydia says she’ll try to figure out if Vvaraak is actually insane. Lux jokingly suggests maybe Vvaraak should go through the psych eval. 

Eventually, the crew all retreats for the night, getting a proper night’s rest in the safety of the tower. 

The following morning, they have breakfast and discuss what they’ll do that day. They agree to go see Lina so they can tell her that they’ll take her up on her offer and ask her what exactly they need for the expedition. After that, they intend to go talk to the Laisha family, after which they hope to go to the bar where Lux’s note told them to go. 

They manage to find [[Lina]] at her and Esme’s apartment complex, where she seems somewhat surprised to see them. When they tell her why they’re there, she pulls them into a corner of the lobby, pulling a candle from her bag and lighting, creating a bubble of silence around them so they can’t be overheard. 

She tells them that, outside of the crew, four more people will be joining of her organization, and she intends to go as well. She then mentions that they want to get some Resurrection scrolls from House Jorasco, which leads to Galen questioning whether or not Lina has told Esme that she is going along as well. He wishes her good luck with that conversation.

She goes on to estimate the expedition will cost anywhere from seven to thirteen thousand gold, and her plan was to talk to some wealthy Cyrian families to get them to sponsor at least part of it. She was planning to have a more comprehensive mission brief by tomorrow night, as there’s a gala that’s happening then, where she was planning on finding some of said sponsors. 

Both Lux and Bonzo think they know of some Cyrian families that they could potentially ask. Lina then says they also need a component still; Graveshroud Orchidpowder, which they should be able to find in an apothecary in lower dura called the Copper Huntress. She does point out it’s somewhat of an illegal product. This component will help keep them safe and they’ll need roughly thirty six grams of it. 

Saying their good-byes to Lina then, the crew sets out to find a skycoach to take them down to lower dura. They find one easily, travelling by the lower wards, the people there scrambling by each other by ants. There’s a world of difference between the upper and lower parts of the town, which is even more notable when they exit the skycoach.

Before they step outside, Lux switches her clothing to something more appropriate for the area. They’re met with the smell of old ale as they exit the skycoach and a lot of the buildings around them are in rubble, closed down at some point. The skycoach driver points them in the direction of the driver and then seems eager to leave, though he does warn the crew to keep an eye on their purse in this area.

On the opposite end of the square they were dropped off on, they see a window facade and a sign that reads ‘The Copper Huntress’. They cross the square and head inside, finding a bare bones shop inside. There’s a single desk, with walls lined with dusty cabinets and a ceiling with dry herbs hanging down from it. There’s a doorway in the back, which seems to lead to a workshop, from which blue light is emination. 

A doorbell announced their presence and both Galen and Rydia recognise the goblin language as there’s some cursing from the back. A very pale goblin emerges, wearing a bronze eye mask with large lenses. He asks then what he can help them with, Rydia first asking for some vials before they then ask the goblin about the orchidpowder they need. 

![[goblin-alchemist.png]]

He initially tells them to get out, suddenly and clearly very uncomfortable. He then asks who sent them, saying he told them he doesn’t want anything to do with them anymore. “Was it the bloodhorn guy?” After some more questioning, it becomes clear that the goblin is afraid they’re with the [[Daask]]. “No, we’re not with the Daask, the Daask try to kill us on a regular basis,” Galen explains, which instantly seems to put the goblin at ease.

Now more willing to talk to the group, he explains that the Daask would ask him for this orchidpowder instead and as he’s unwilling to do business with them, he’s stopped getting it for the store. Hence he has nothing in stock for the group, but he is willing to tell them where they can find the orchids themselves: across the river, in the Osceola Wetlands. 

He describes the flower for them as well; it’s a greyish black, droopy flower, which comes to life when touched with electricity. This turns it into a red flower. After gathering some of the flower, you can simply grind it up into a powder. 

With that information gathered, the crew looks around the store some more, Bonzo spotting an interesting looking glass jar as Petr discreetly asks the goblin to show him what kind of drugs he has on offer. The goblin heads into the back and returns with a box with three things on offer; Dream Lily, some fried pieces of root as well as a vial of thick red liquid. He explains the pieces of root are called chips, and they make you hallucinate, as well as feel warm and cuddly inside. 

The red vial contains dragon’s blood, which Petr knows is very illegal. It enhances one’s magical prowess for an hour, after which you’re forced into a sleep. Petr buys both the dragon blood and some of the chips for two hundred and sixty gold and Bonzo buys the glass jar for three gold. The glass jar contains an ointment made of mushrooms, rumored to be from Thelanis, the faerie realm. It allows whoever uses it to gain the benefits of a Pass Without a Trace spell and can be used three times. 

Bonzo then briefly talks to the goblin about how he’s protecting his store against the Daask, the goblin pointing up at the bell above the door, which seems to have a black, supposedly explosive compound attached. He says he’s only been able to make it once, and he intends to go visit some people at the university to help him figure out what it is and what it does exactly. Bonzo tells him he’s interested and will probably drop by again at a later time to check in how that progresses.

With the information they need, they leave the apothecary and after Rydia makes a quick stop to give a homeless man a muffin, they decide to head towards the wetlands. Galen knows this is a fairly large area that’s known to be the location here a big battle took place. Realising they might have a lot of ground to cover, they find a boat to rent and head out there. 

On the way there, Lux asks Galen if he knows about any good magic shops in the city, sharing that he hopes to find someone who can help him put a protective spell on the doorknob where they’re keeping the Eye safe. Galen knows there might be some shops in the university area, but doesn’t remember any specific shops they could go to. 

The crew soon finds themselves on the opposite side of the river, where soggy swamplands greet them. They look around, Lux finding a stick so she can cast Shocking Grasp on it, hoping to maybe find where the flowers are, as those react to electricity. Strangely, when she casts the spell, there’s no electricity whatsoever and instead, the ground underneath her freezes over. 

Changing tactics, she turns to Rydia, asking if she’d like to be able to get a better view as they’re looking around and right as she polymorphs Rydia into a giant owl, Petr pulls out his staff and casts Locate Animals or Plants. The spell tells him where to go and how far it is and they set out in that direction, Rydia flying overhead and keeping an eye on things. She spots what looks to be some sort of trap; a goat tethered to a tree that seems to be alive, and manages to guide the group to go around this. 

In about an hour, they find themselves almost where Petr’s spell told them to go. Rydia does one last fly around, spotting more and more pieces of metal littered around the landscape in the distance. There’s the massive remains of a warforged titan up ahead, with a glowing red light near it which she recognises as the flower they’re looking for. 

She lands near the group, the polymorph wearing of so she can share what she found, pointing out exactly where the orchid was. Galen suggests he can sneak ahead, the others agreeing and hanging back as he quietly moves further into the swamp. He hears a faint growling chant as he gets closer and manages to hide as a little door opens from the head of the warforged a little up ahead. A bipedal frog creature emerges, calling out, which causes three smaller frog creatures to appear from another part of the warforged. They move up to where the larger one is.

Galen manages to stay hidden and quiet enough to not be noticed, waiting for the little door to shut again before cutting off part of one of the large orchid leafs. It turns grey as he cuts it off and he tucks it away before sneaking back, managing to reach the group without getting noticed. He tells them he has what they need and urges them to leave so they do so. 

As they’re making their escape, it’s not long until they hear a loud, angry croaking sound; the frog like creatures may have noticed that someone took some of the flower. Though the group manages to get quite a bit away, it’s not too long until it becomes clear the frog like creatures have given pursuit, and eventually they manage to catch up.

The large creature appears across part of the river, accompanied by seven smaller creatures and though Petr attempts to speak to them, it quickly becomes obvious the creatures are not interested in talking. Combat ensues, Rydia casting Sickening Radiance atop the entire group of creatures and managing to deal quite a lot of damage; enough to allow the others to pick off the smaller creatures one by one.  

The larger creature throws a Cloudkill at the group, the disappears into the water and they almost don’t see it, until Petr spots movement in the water. He casts Blight, hitting the creature, which becomes visible and one well aimed shot from Galen is enough to finish it off. With the threat dealt with, the group continues on their way back towards their boat.
