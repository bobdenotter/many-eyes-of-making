# Tip the Scales

Everyone in the group takes a moment to rest up, Rydia preparing some snacks for everyone down in the amphitheatre. Bonzo eventually comes down from the ship, offering up one of the pies he brought with from home, granting everyone a little extra protection for whatever happens next. “Is it supposed to smell like this?,” Petr asks, to which Bonzo says it might be a bit stale, but everyone eats it anyway.

Beck seeks out Galen, who’s still up in the airship. He knocks on the door, which is open, so he lets himself in, finding Galen in his bunk. He has his giant leatherbound journal out, playing with the pocket watch in his hand. When he asks Galen if he’s alright, Galen simply quotes Rydia: he hasn’t been okay in a long while.

They talk about Rydia, Beck saying she’s back to normal, with Galen saying that it’s as good as it’s going to get. Beck suggests they’re looking for answers, which could lead to more of an answer and, if Rydia wants it, perhaps something to fix the situation.

Galen apologises, saying it’s been a long day and when Beck brings up the dragons, Galen admits that wasn’t the worst part of his day. “You said to Rashaak it was an accident we found that book,” he says, to which Beck attempts to clarify that what he meant to say that they probably weren’t purposely looking for whatever it was that happened to Rydia.

“The rest wasn’t an accident,” Galen admits, saying he’d been looking for that book for years. He didn’t know everything about it, nor what it would do to her, or the rest of them. “The rest of you?” Beck asks, and Galen explains it wasn’t just him and Rydia who were looking for the book.

“That thing she kept saying, it means Golden Grin. That was what we called ourselves.” There were four of them. “And the other two?” Beck asks, to which Galen says they got along well, explaining who the other two were. A woman named Cassandra. “She was brilliant, smart. Way smarter than me. Helped me find the book and was never prepared to deal with any of my shit, which made us work.” The other person was Hulgyr. “More for the heavy lifting.”

He then explains how they decided on their name. “He was a half-orc and he’d repaired a tusk with some gold…” Galen goes on to explain what happened when they found the book. “Rydia touched the book. I passed out and when I woke up they were gone, and so was the book. Pretty sure they ended up in the same place.”

Beck remains quiet, so Galen continues, saying he always figured they were dead, but he never really thought Rydia ate them. “Wishful thinking?” Beck says, adding that maybe that was what Galen was doing, and maybe it wasn’t Rydia at all; the book seems to have a mind of its own after all.

“Either way all this is on me,” Galen says, to which Beck points out that’s a lot to take on. “The only reason we were there was because I wanted the damned thing. And somehow, I’m the only one that walked away the same as I was.” He concludes saying that clearly, considering all that, he’s not alright.

“So what’re you hoping to find?” Beck asks him, Galen saying he’s looking for answers. He then brings up what Vvaraak said, about Rydia having a purpose. “If that’s true then maybe someday I’ll forgive myself.” Beck says he hopes that will happen.

Galen then says he’d understand if Beck and the others don’t want to further involve themselves with this. “I didn’t lie before when I said she’s never tried to hurt me,” he says, to which Beck adds that Rydia has never tried to hurt any of the others either. Galen points out that maybe Rashaak was right about Rydia not always being herself; he’s prepared to deal with that, but he’s not expecting the others to do so as well.

“She’s done me no harm,” Beck points out and when Galen asks him if he’s always this nice, he says it depends. “On whether or not people have helped save my life or not,” he elaborates when asked. Galen goes on to say that he wouldn’t blame him for wanting them off his ship, to which Beck points out that apparently something is coming, and it sounds rather serious.

“So if anything we might try and find out more about that whilst we’re here anyway,” he offers, to which Galen says he’s going through with this to the end. “We’re in this together for now,” Beck adds, despite Galen pointing out that the last people who worked with him are dead. “We’ll try and avoid that.”

“Can you do me a favor?” Galen then asks, pointing out he’s not always objective when it comes to Rydia, which Beck admits he’s noticed. “The day I’ve actually lost my mind, I need you to tell me. Even if I don’t wanna hear it.” Beck agrees to this. “This is manageable for now and she’s stronger than anyone gives her credit for, but one day .. she might end up like she was out there and I don’t know what to do about it.”

Speaking of, Galen admits that she wasn’t in a coma for that time. She was in a state almost similar to the one she was in earlier; some days she was quiet, other days she would talk non-stop. She didn’t look like how she looked before, but it felt similar in other ways, and it lasted a lot longer before.

“So yeah, I’m worried. I don’t know how to fix all that, I don’t know how to stop it from coming back,” Galen says, to which Beck suggests that Rydia spoke to Vvaraak and that might lead to more answers. Finishing up the conversation, Beck points out there’s food down below and they should probably strategize about how they want to approach this situation, so the two of them climb down from the airship and join up with the others.

Meanwhile, Rydia seeks out Bonzo. She asks him if he build Betsy, which Bonzo confirms. “Why are you asking?” When asked if he builds things a lot, Bonzo confirms this, asking Rydia if she needs anything.

“I just remembered … things I prefer not to remember,” Rydia tells him. “And I’d like them to not happen again.” Bonzo asks her to be more specific, to which Rydia says that he’s afraid of her, which he immediately confirms. “That’s why I’m asking you.”

“Yes, but what are you asking me?” She asks him if he can invent something to stop her, if necessary. “Stop you how?” Bonzo asks, to which Rydia says that’s a good question. Bonzo points out they all have weapons they could use to stop her, but Rydia says that seems unwieldy. “I’m not sure if this is something that can be done, something that makes me stop … more easily.”

Bonzo once again asks her to specify. “Stop eating? Stop moving? Living?” Rydia points out the last two will cover the first one. “Galen isn’t always objective when it comes to me,” Rydia points out, which Bonzo says he’s noticed. “What if Rashaak is right? About me? What if I lose control or .. what if I get too hungry?”

He asks her what she thinks will happen if she loses control, which Rydia doesn’t answer, instead apologising, thinking maybe this was a mistake. “I can help you, but I’m not sure if I want to, because this is a lot you’re asking of me,” Bonzo says. “I want to help you get better, there’s probably ways to fix this, there’s always ways to fix something.”

Rydia says she appreciates that, thanking him. She asks him if he can still try and think of something, which Bonzo says he will. “Do you want me to let you know when I’ve thought of something?” Rydia says maybe not. “Maybe someone needs to stay afraid. I think that’s good for everyone,” she says, to which Bonzo is quick to say he’s still afraid. “I haven’t felt this afraid. There’s something of a feeling overcoming me. I feel very much afraid of you now.”

They thank each other before Rydia points out Galen and Beck, who are coming down from the ship and the group reconvenes. They first attempt to summarize what they know. They have the key to the barracks, and they should be able to find the other two keys to reach the Eye in those barracks. They also know there’s about thirty of forty of the Black Scales in total, and they go out in smaller groups to perform rituals, though they don’t know if that’s at a set time. They all carry a shard in their eye. There’s also an obelisk in the middle of the city that’s been enchanted by shamans to give the Black Scales an extra eye in the city.

Along with Nerima, who eventually comes back from her rounds, they discuss a number of possible tactics. They eventually decide to split up; Beck will go with the dragonborn guardians towards the center of town, to create a distraction there. Once he creates the initial distraction, the guardians will try to keep the distraction going as he heads towards the barracks. Nerima suggests that what will likely most distract them is the sight of their sworn enemy; green-skinned lizardfolk of the Poisoned Dusk clan. The others will hide nearer to the barracks, so they can all reconvene there and then make their way inside.

There’s a gong on a guard tower that’s sounded for alarm, usually guarded by a grunt of the Black Scales. Once that alarm is sounded, people will come back to the barracks, so they decide it’s a good idea to take that out as well. They also decide that, whilst they will take out any Black Scales they come across, their main goal will be to retrieve the keys so they can get to the Eye. Nerima also asks them, if possible, to bring back the bodies of their dragonborn brethren, so they can bring those back to life and give themselves more reinforcements. Nerima also gives Beck a small, triangular shaped holy symbol depicting three dragons surrounding a central orb, which she says will give them access to the crypt, which is supposed to be a safe space within the barracks.

She also shares that the Black Scales were initially interested in the key that Nerima and the others have, as they wanted to use the Eye to communicate with their deity, but they’ve since changed plans to just trying to bring him back altogether.

With a plan agreed upon, they split up. Beck and the guardians, who have shed their armor to be quieter, manage to sneak their way towards an overlook of the main square of the city, giving them an overview of the place. He notices, now that they’re closer, a snake with wings, wrapped around the obelisk in the middle of the square. After Nerima points out one of the buildings, Beck uses Major Image to make a group of the Poisoned Dusk lizardfolk appear, filling up a twenty foot square to make as many of them appear as possible.

As the others move towards the barracks, they have to move to the side and hide as a group of Black Scales comes rushing by, seemingly heading towards where Beck just created the distraction. Though Bonzo almost gets spotted, they manage to remain unseen and continue on their way towards the barracks.

Beck, after maintaining the illusion of the Poisoned Dusk lizardfolk and eventually making them move into a building, makes himself look like one of the Black Scales before he starts making his way towards the barracks as well.

Though he attempts to stay hidden, he gets spotted by the approaching group of scales, and the leader makes the entire group stop as they notice him. “Devya, I thought you were on guard duty at the river crossing,” he says in draconic, to which Beck replies, also in draconic, “They’re over there, I saw them run into a building!”

The leader asks Beck to join, who instead tries to talk him into letting him go get back up, but he’s not very persuasive, so he’s forced to stick with the group regardless. He tries to argue, which only gets him punched in the face and told off for mouthing off his superior. Though Beck follows for a while, then eventually points ahead, claiming he sees one up ahead. He feigns charging at the ‘enemy’, managing to move to the side and split away from the group, turning back around as the rest of the group still charges ahead.

Beck eventually manages to find his way back towards the rest of the group, who have gathered a little bit away from the barracks and are taking in their surroundings. They can see most of the main building, as well as the tower that has the gong on it. The roof of one section of the building is completely slouched and slumped to the side and the entire building is overgrown with vines and other greenery. Behind the building is a bloodied sandpit, to the side of which there’s stables.

As they want to move closer, they hear three loud booming sounds at the same time, which some of them recognise as Shatter spells that seem to collapse one of the buildings a way behind them. It comes from the direction Beck came from, suggesting it might be the guardians’ doing.

They have to cross quite an open space to get to the barracks, so they decide not to all go at once. Beck goes first, changing back into his Black Scale disguise and casually strolling across towards the barracks. As he approaches, Beck notices the decaying body of a dragonborn on one of the spears sticking out of the building. He also notices a human man, tied up to a wooden post, seemingly still alive. It’s an older man, looking very thin, clearly beaten, wearing dirty ragged clothing.

He gets noticed, but doesn’t get stopped and he heads straight up towards where another Black Scale is standing guard by the gong, striking up a conversation with this Black Scale in an attempt to give the others a better chance at crossing without getting noticed. From atop the tower, Beck notices that the floor near the administration building is littered with palm leaves, and there’s four statues of dragonborn warriors, mainly intact.

As Beck heads up, the other Black Scale asks him what he wants, to which Beck says he’s bored and he just wanted a good view of the fight happening across town. The Black Scale says he heard a collapse and he shouted it down, alerting the others inside, gesturing at the stairs Beck just climbed, which seem to spiral back down.

Taking his chance to look at the gong, Beck realises it hangs from a massive iron chain, attached to a thick wooden log. Getting it down without it clattering to the floor and down the stairs seems like it might be very difficult. Mentally storing that information, Beck keeps making small talk as down below, Petr is the second one attempting to cross towards the barracks.

He manages to do so without getting spotted, but Bonzo is less lucky and the Black Scale atop the tower notices him as he tries to cross. Beck moves quickly, punching the Black Scale before grappling him, holding him in place and managing to hold on long enough for Bonzo to get a chance to hide again and Petr to run up the stairs to help him.

Beck and Petr manage to knock the Black Scale out, but not before it lets out a loud screech, which seems to alert others. Petr hears footsteps coming up and it’s not long before two lizardfolk exit out of the main door, looking up. One of them shouts up in draconic, asking what’s going on. “Yeah, sorry, I stubbed my toe,” Beck calls out in draconic, which isn’t convincing enough to stop them from saying they’re going to send up a replacement.

Translating this for Petr, he and Beck realise they’ve just gained maybe a little bit of time. Bonzo eventually makes his way up towards the two of them as well and as Beck casts Silence, Petr and Bonzo focus on the wooden beam the gong hangs from, managing to destroy that. Bonzo does use a brick to try and knock it away, which works, but the brick also crashes into the roof of the barracks, making noise. The gong falls down, Petr and Beck only just managing to catch it and stop it from falling down the stairs. Beck then pulls out his doorknob, making a door appear underneath the gong and making it fall into the interdimensional space of the doorknob.

Meanwhile, Galen and Rydia sneak across and though Rydia isn’t too quiet, there doesn’t seem to be anyone on watch as they cross, so no one immediately reacts to them heading towards the barracks. They keep an eye on the door leading towards the barracks, staying hidden outside. Petr, Bonzo and Beck head down then, meeting up with Galen and Rydia and they all follow the window stairs further down.

They all head down, finding themselves in a large chamber that’s dark, as it is underground, meaning that some of the group can’t see very much. Bonzo and Petr provided some light via magic and a torch and they start looking around the room. The hallway up ahead is intricately decorated, with flimsy doors leading towards more decorations and a larger, equally decorated door down the hall. To the east is a large storage room filled with barrels and crates from House Therashk.

Upon closer inspection, there’s arrow slits on both sides of the door, making them think that this hallway might be trapped. Galen suggests they go around and so they head towards and other room, the one to the east of the hallway. Galen moves up to a doorway leading south, after which he hears breathing, so they decide not to head down there either.

Beck checks whether or not the holy symbol he was given works, finding the room that Nerima pointed out. As he holds up the symbol, the walls open up, revealing a stairway down. Satisfied that the symbol works, Beck joins the others as they continue to explore the area.

Petr inspects the room further to the east and, as he looks down into the room that seems to be attached to that room, notices a barricade, aimed towards them. He alerts the others, and then everything happens fast. Petr suddenly gets turned into a rat, a horn is blown, somehwhere in the complex and right at that time four creatures appear in the room the others are still in; two kobolds seemingly coming out the wall and two Black Scales climbing out a hole in the middle of the room.

Combat ensues, with Petr the mouse running down into the room he saw the barricade to investigate as the others fight the four creatures that appeared. As they’re dealing with those, four more creatures join the party: crocodiles, getting summoned by more Black Scales that Petr finds hiding behind the barricades. One of them manages to catch Petr, who’s still a mouse, underneath a cup.

Though the others manage to deal with the two scales in the main room, as well as with one of the kobolds, the crocodiles begin approaching and before long, there’s a sound coming from the south. As those still in the room turn to look, they watch as a triceratops appears out of the hallway they thought was trapped, clearly looking corrupted in some way or another and thrashing wildly in anger.
