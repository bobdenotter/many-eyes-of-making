# Veiled Threats
Upstairs, Beren brings up what Galen said to him about the crystals not too long ago, asking what to do about Jonah wanting them. Galen mentions the ‘disagreement’ he had with Jonah not long ago, before confirming that he himself and the crew are still after the crystals themselves. His father mentions what happened with him and ‘you know who’, Galen admitting that’s actually what partially sparked him wanting to go after them. Plus, he thinks this is important in general. He doesn’t want anyone to cause another Mourning. 

Beren says that he knows when to pull his hands off, reminding Galen that’s exactly what he did with Galen’s mother. He does say he trusts Galen to do the right thing a whole lot more than he ever trusted Ophelia to do so. He does reiterate he’s not getting the family business involved with this, Galen saying that he wouldn’t ever want to put the family in danger and therefore doesn’t want them involved either. 

Daphne interjects, asking what Galen meant when he said that he and Jonah had a disagreement. Not wanting to tell her everything, Galen simply tells her that Jonah clearly values his house over anything else. He promises he didn’t come here to ruin her relationship, but they had their disagreements and he doesn’t know how much he trusts Jonah right now. Daphne promises she’ll keep her eyes open. 

Downstairs, Beck greets his mom with a hug, both of them surprised to see each other here. She tells him that she’s here for work, gathering information on Mister Cannith’s ‘most esteemed guests’. Beck asks if she means the D’Arcy family, but his mom says it includes him and the crew as well. 

He asks her why she needs information on them, to which his mom says she probably should have told him something a long time ago. She asks Beck if he knows why the family moved to Metrol in the first place all that time ago. Beck says that he always thought it was because they wanted some more stability in their life, which she does confirm. 

“We thought that the espionage and assassination business wasn’t a great place to raise a kid,” she adds, saying she and Beck’s father have been working for house Thuranni for decades. She says it’s shocking to see him here, though it’s also good to see him. “Why are you in this guy’s crosshairs?” she asks, Beck saying it’s a long story. 

Petr, still a spider, has found the two of them by now, but hangs back, having seen Beck and this other person share a hug. 

Beck suggests they can catch up some other time. His mom agrees, but does say that Jonah is keeping tabs on all of them. Beck points out that he tried to kill them before, which surprises his mom, Beck saying he did already yell at him about it. “Apparently his house comes first.” 

Aunnin then says that the main thing she was supposed to find out was how they’d be getting into the Mournland and surviving. Beck tells her he doesn’t know the technicalities of it, adding that as far as he knows, the mission is not really secret either. She suggests that they shouldn’t talk about this now, repeating that information is the thing House Cannith is most after. “Keep that card close to your chest”. Jonah apparently wants to know the details. 

She then mentions the wooden horse as well, Beck commenting on how Jonah’s still upset about the horse as well. His mom seems somewhat annoyed at how deeply involved he seems to be, so he just tells her there’s a lot going on. She shifts back then, as to not arouse any suspicion, stepping out after urging Beck to tell his friends that they’re being monitored. 

Beck asks if his father is here too, Aunnin saying he’s back at the carnival. She also says she’ll say they came up empty wanting to find out this information; Beck then tells her where they’re docked at Lyrander tower, in case she wants to talk more. 

The two of them leave the pantry, Beck rejoining the party, spider Petr climbing onto his pant leg unnoticed as he makes his way back upstairs. As soon as he’s back upstairs, Beck shoots Rydia a look, who catches on and sends him a telepathic message. He summarises what just happened and what he was told, Rydia relaying the message to the rest of the group right as Jonah and Merrix return, the two of them having excused themselves earlier. 

As everyone reclaims their seat at the table, the first course of the night is served. Over dinner, Merrix asks about the mission that was mentioned before that would send the crew into the Mournland. Galen and Beck answer his questions, but are vague in their answers, not wanting to divulge too much information. 

Merrix changes the subject, turning to Beren to ask him about the wooden horse. He further explains that they would need it to convince Terala, mentioning a project that Zorlan d’Cannith is working on with some gnomes, in Karrnath. When Beck asks him about the project, he mentions Karrnath and Cannith East working together on an old fortress of sorts. This sounds familiar to Bonzo, who asks if there’s perhaps someone named Jodd Uthar Jorell working on the project. Merrix says that there is a Zilargo gnome involved. 

Bonzo then asks exactly how Jonah and Merrix are planning on stopping Zorlan from getting into power. Merrix explains that there hasn’t been a new Baron of House d’Cannith since the war, and that the most likely candidate is Zorlan, as he’s the oldest member of the house who also trained under those in Cyre, just like Jonah has. 

If they can get Terala d’Cannith on their side, then Merrix himself can become Baron and he can put things in place that will make sure that Zorlan won’t have so much power anymore. In order to make sure they get Terala’s vote, Merrix and Jonah think two things need to happen. Finding concrete evidence of Yonhanna’s letters to her lover, and doctoring fake letters to show Terala. Secondly, they need to find a way to fix what caused the Mourning, which involves finding the Eyes / crystals and destroying them all. 

Galen asks how they plan on destroying the crystals, which Merrix admits he doesn’t know yet. They interacted with the crystal before and found it morphed shape, making destroying it rather difficult. When asked where they found this initial crystal that caused the Mourning, Merrix says it was found in a crevasse underneath Making that leads to Khyber. They found it because the people in Clawrift seemed to be having collective dreams, both good and bad. They created a device that pinpointed what caused these dreams and that wound up leading them to the crystal.

He further explains they learned it had a connection to the Planes, even the one to which connections have been closed of, Dal’Quor. After having explained all this, Merrix and Jonah excuse themselves once more and the group takes the time to discuss everything that’s been said. This once again has them bringing up how they don’t trust Jonah, considering what happened in the past and when Daphne asks once again what exactly they mean, Rydia urges Galen to just tell her.

He instead asks her to do so, so Rydia does, with Galen adding to the story of how their last encounter with Jonah went as well. Galen also warns her that he thinks there’s a chance Jonah is using her to get to their dad. This leaves Daphne visibly upset and she excuses herself. 

Galen laments not having wanted to upset Daphne, talking about how his family can be complicated at times. Beren adds that in this family people seem to sometimes pick questionable partners. Helena gets up to go check on Daphne. She hasn’t said a word all evening, but now says: “I hope this is the final encounter we’ll have with your mom. Every time that woman shows up, it’s trouble.” She looks at Beren and Galen when she says this, then heads down. 

Beck asks about this, having been under the impression that Helena is Galen’s mom. Galen explains she’s his step-mom, but also the only mom he’s ever really had. He mentions connections to Karrnath, saying they can talk about this more later as he doesn’t want Jonah to know more about this. 

Jonah and Merrix eventually return and once everyone except Daphne and Helena takes their seats, the second course of the meal is presented. Merrix digs right into the food and, after a moment, tells the crew as well as Beren that he’s honestly somewhat surprised and disappointed by everyone’s lukewarm reactions to what they were told that evening. 

This turns the conversation into something somewhat awkward and tense. Merrix seems uncomfortable with the fact that the crew and the D’Arcys know so much about House d’Cannith and he has no reassurances that they won’t just tell the truth about what they know. Beck and Galen do most of the talking as they assure him they have no reason to go public with this, sharing that they’ve known most of this for a while and they haven’t mentioned any of it to anyone. 

Merrix still seems to want some sort of deal, something on paper that he can use as leverage in case something goes wrong, Galen suggesting that they can use the deal for the wooden horse for that. Merrix has been speaking to Beren about that, knowing the horse is going to be up for auction but hoping he can make a bid outside of auction and just buy the horse. Beren isn’t opposed to this, but when asked if he’ll help house Cannith look for the crystals he declines, citing personal reasons. 

They agree to a deal for the horse, Merrix somewhat satisfied to have this as leverage. He also says he’ll invest in the mission. Though some of the tension seems to be resolved, Rydia as well as some others of the crew seem confused at how House Cannith seemed to be threatening them. With the deal for the wooden horse agreed upon, Merrix turns more jovial though, inviting everyone to have some drinks now that dinner is mostly done. 

Curious, Beck asks him if he really plans on forging the letters that were found in the wooden horse, suggesting that might be a bad way to build trust with Terala. Merrix assures him that he’ll build trust later, they just need to get her vote for now. He then asks to speak to Bonzo, curious about his connection with Jodd. 

He asks about the Architects, Bonzo admitting that he used to be part of them. He says he hopes that Karrnath won’t be able to pull off what they’re trying to do. He also heard about how the Architects were going to appeal the Brelish King, promising he’ll put his own weight behind that appeal as well in an attempt to help. 

Eventually, the evening comes to a close and, after ‘borrowing’ a few bottles of alcohol, the crew excuses themselves and start heading back towards Lyrander tower. On the way back, Galen turns to Rydia, telling her he loves her. He thanks her for standing up for him and his family, after which Rydia says she loves him too, the two of them holding hands as they all make their way back. 

There’s the suggestion of talking things through that night, but Beck suggests that, as it’s been a long day, perhaps they should sleep on it, so they do.

The following morning, Galen asks for a strong cup of coffee, before sharing some more about who his mother really is. Beck jokes about how he waited til morning in the hopes that people wouldn’t be awake and therefore won’t ask too many questions, Galen saying that’s not entirely untrue. 

He still shares the story regardless. His father married his mom, Helena, when Galen was a kid. She’s the only mother he’s really ever had and the only one that matters. The fact that he’s not Helena’s biological son isn’t a secret. His real mother ditched him on his dad as soon as he was born and went back to Karrnath, where she was from. Daphne is his half sister.

Galen goes on to say that he was young and restless and when he left home he felt like everyone was disappointed in him for not going into the family business. Eventually, he found some research from Ophelia Vidante, who is his mother. He wanted to know more about her; she was researching the same kind of stuff that he was looking into.

“For the first time I felt like I might have family that understood what I was doing with my life”. He did find his mom and for a while, he did feel like she understood him. He worked for her, wanting to get to know her better and because she was his mother, he overlooked a lot of the things that she was doing.

“Eventually we were on the road and we found a town that was half demolished. Instead of helping the survivors, she had them all killed so she could use them as her personal army…” That was the last straw for Galen. He stole her research and he left, now wanting to stop her from getting what she was looking for. She was looking for items, things of power.

There was one thing she never wanted him to look at, so he stole those notes. They were on the Tome of Vvaraak. She wanted it and he didn’t want her to have it, so he went looking for it. 

At the party yesterday, his dad mentioned his mom as well. What he was talking about was that she was here, in Sharn, looking for the Eyes, a good thirty to forty years ago. She asked Beren to help her look for them, but they never found them.  

He concludes the story by saying she’s not a good person, and he wished he wasn’t related to her. “She’s wrapped up in whatever this shit is with Erandis and the Council and she is the one who made damn sure that I have Erandis Vol’s blood.” He mentions the dreams he brought up before, of the experiments that were performed on him. His mother was present for those. “I think she made sure that Erandis Vol’s blood was put into me, because they need me for something and I don’t know for what.” He’s made it his responsibility to stop her from getting what she wants.

“I have her name, but I’m not happy about it,” Galen adds, explaining that he has her last name as well. When asked, he begrudgingly admits his full name is Gallanos Raban Vidante D’Arcy. 

He goes on to say that he knows what the Karrnathi are like; he was there for years. He also points out that Jonah is working with Dahlia, and he’s from Karrnath; Galen says he can’t trust anything to do with that place as it might be linked to his mom and those she works with. 

“I think we’ve established we can trust very little,” Rydia points out, though the crew points out they hope they can trust each other. This prompts Rydia to try and guess the command word of her necklace, the others pointing out it’s better if she doesn’t know it. 

Beck then suggests that perhaps they should message Lina to give her a heads up about everything that happened last night, mentioning the fact that they put some money on her tab at Mun’s as well. Galen, having been unaware of this, isn’t too pleased about this, but can’t do much about the situation in the moment. 

Rydia messages Lina, using the limited amount of words her spell grants her to explain what happened. Lina replies almost immediately, noting how cryptic of a message it was. She says she understands, but if they want to talk more they should come find her at the Order, as she has some shit to deal with. She sounds quite tense. 

They discuss what ‘shit’ Lina might be dealing with, deciding to check in on her just to make sure. They make their way down the tower and just as they leave, Beck spots his mom making her way towards the tower. The rest note she looks almost somewhat like Lux, dressed simply, like an adventurer. 

She asks about last night, saying Merrix and Jonah seemed pretty pissed that they didn’t reveal more information about how they’d be getting to the Mournland. Beck points out it’s still not really a secret, but they didn’t tell them regardless. She then asks if Beck has encountered anyone from yesterday; the other servants, as most of them were also changelings who were tasked with keeping an eye on them. 

Beck says that no one’s approached them, Aunnin then asking if they saw any elves near them, specifically mentioning her boss, Llevellys, of house Thuranna. She goes on to say that most of her teammates were gone this morning, thinking they might’ve left her behind because they saw her talking to him last night. “So you’re in trouble?” She claims she’s not, she’s just trying to figure out where the rest of her team went. 

Turning to the others, Beck then introduces Aunnin to the rest of the crew. Beck explains she’s in town for business, Aunnin saying she’s usually more involved with entertainment, but that wasn’t the case this time. She then excuses herself, though tells Beck that she’s here til the end of the week if he wants to get a drink later. 

Beck urges her to be careful, as it seems weird to him that her team has disappeared, but she assures him she’s fairly sure they won’t hurt her. She was worried for a moment they were after the crew, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. 

She goes to get some breakfast, giving Beck a kiss on the forehead before she walks of. Petr asks if they shouldn’t have offered her a place to stay, Beck assuring him she can take care of herself. “It just sounds a bit shady that her team just up and left, must be the weirdest way to get fired ever,” Petr points out, Beck saying the whole thing is weird to him in general as he didn’t know she worked for House Thuranni in the first place. 

The crew then continue on their way to the Order, where they find the place in somewhat of a disarray. Galen calls out to Lina, who appears after a few moments, looking somewhat less put together than she usually does. She explains that various alarms went off in the place last night and they’ve been spending most of their morning looking through everything to see if something is missing.

So far, they haven’t found anything yet. They head into Lina’s office to speak somewhere they have somewhat more privacy, the crew informing her of what happened last night. They note the coincidence of something having happened here the night after they told House Cannith that they were working together with the Order, but though Rydia and Beck consider going to find Jonah, they decide against it.

Instead, the group helps Lina and some of the other Order members clean up, Rydia keeping an eye out for any items out of place. Bonzo and Beck attempt to help with some Detect Magic spells, though Lina says she already tried that.

As they’re cleaning, Rydia notes that Thelos, the elf who was working on the magic to transport everyone to the Mournland safely, doesn’t seem to be present. She tells Beck, who turns to Lina, asking her if it’s odd that Thelos isn’t here. Lina shrugs it off a little, saying he’s an elf and she’s not too surprised he’s not helping clean up the mess, but the crew still decides to check in on him, in case something is wrong.

Rydia casts Sending, asking him where he is and if everything is alright. It takes a moment before the elf responds and he sounds somewhat tense. He tells her he’s alright, and he’s currently in Lower Dura, at a place called the Anvil. Rydia relays the message, Petr sharing with the group what he knows about the Anvil; it’s a relatively safe place in the lower wards, ran by the Boromar clan. 

As Thelos sounded somewhat in distress, Rydia sends him another message, telling him that if he isn’t safe, suggesting he should say ‘pea soup’ if he needs help, as that can be worked into a sentence. “I’m perfectly fine. Everything is great. I’m just about to order a plate of pea soup,” is the message she gets in return.

Right as she receives it, ‘Thelos’ walks through the front door of the Order headquarters, apologizing for not having been here before. Rydia instantly tells everyone about the message she received, telling them she’s pretty sure that’s not really him.
