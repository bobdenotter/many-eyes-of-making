# Strange Bedfellows
As the commotion continues around Lux and Bonzo, they both think back of what it even was they saw.  Though it happened in a flash, Lux recalls bare feet, as well as a person with wings and talons, making her think this was some sort of shifter. They had long hair and were wearing a white outfit. 

Looking around, they attempt to listen in on the conversations around them to figure out what happened, but most conversations are hushed and there’s so many people that it’s hard to make out details. Curious, Lux suggests to Bonzo that maybe they should ask some of the Sharn Watch for directions to [[Lord Zolan]], and maybe they can ask about what happened as well. 

Bonzo agrees, so Lux approaches a group of guards. She apologises for interrupting them, then asks for some directions, which one of the guards that initially chased the winged person is able to give her. She then asks what just happened, and she and Bonzo are told that someone just stole something from the Brelish Museum of Fine Art, which they realise is the building they’re standing near. 

Not asking for more details, they head towards the Great Hall of Aureon, passing by a bridge where some magewrights are working on statues that flank said bridge. The bridge leads to a large, dome like building, with an egg shaped smaller one atop with balconies around it.

More statues flank the door to the building they enter, depicting the robed figure of Aureon. Inside, they find a hallway with lecture rooms, though the rest of the building suggests it’s also somewhat of a temple. Students with black and red robes fill the hallways as they make their way closer to the main area, where a seemingly sourceless sunlight illuminates a central altar. There’s a massive collection of books behind all this. 

As they’re looking around this crowded area, Lux eventually spots one other gnome, both she and Bonzo assuming that must be [[Lord Zolan]]. She points him out to Bonzo and the two of them approach the gnome. The gnome confirms he is indeed Lord Zolan, but he is very flustered and claims he doesn’t really have time for them now. Whilst he doesn’t seem dismissive of what Bonzo brought to his attention, he is genuinely stressed with all kinds of festival activities (including a reveal at the museum) that need to be taken care of.

Bonzo offers to help, but as Zolan isn’t sure what they would need help with, he refers him to someone named Beatrice, who would know more. Zolan then excuses himself, Bonzo saying he’ll come find him when things are a little less hectic and they can talk then. 

They start making their way back outside then.

Meanwhile, Galen and Rydia are making their way to Galen’s sister, [[Daphne D'Arcy]]. They find her at her apartment at the Cassan Bridge, where she opens the door in casual dress. She has short, dark hair, and greets Galen with a warm hug. 

![[cassan-bridge.jpg]]

She invites the both of them inside, not commenting on Rydia’s mask and cloak, and offers them drinks, which she prestidigitates when they have a seat. This prompts Galen to ask about how school is going, with Daphne saying that things are going well, but she’s been really busy with finals lately. 

Galen then brings up the topic of the family dinner that their dad suggested, asking Daphne about the boyfriend that Beren mentioned. [[Daphne D'Arcy]] admits that she is indeed seeing someone, but says she doesn’t think she’s ready to introduce him to the family just yet. “His name is Jonah,” she says when Galen asks for a name, elaborating that he is part of House Cannith. They’ve only been together for a couple of months, but she does admit she quite likes him. 

As both Galen and Rydia recognise this name, Daphne notes that something seems to be up with her brother, but Galen simply changes the subject, instead introducing Rydia as his girlfriend. 

After this, the two siblings catch each other up with what they’ve been doing, Daphne mentioning that Beren has been talking about Galen a lot, especially after he helped with the [[Q’barra]] situation. This turns the conversation to the family business, with Daphne admitting that she hopes that eventually, Beren will retire, and leave her to run the business as she pleases. 

The conversation goes on, until Daphne eventually admits that she still has quite a lot of studying to do for a test the following day, so she and Galen hug goodbye before Galen and Rydia make their way back out onto the streets of Sharn.

Once out of earshot from Daphne, the two of them talk about how she’s apparently dating Jonah, and how they think the chances of there being more than one Jonah d’Cannith are very slim. They conclude they should talk to Lux about this, Rydia pointing out that either way it’s going to be a strange dinner. 

As they head back and walk by the university, Galen spots Lux in the crowds there, so Rydia uses Sending to reach out to her, asking her where she is. She then does the same to reach out to Petr and in about twenty minutes the whole group has reconvened on the plaza near the museum. 

There, they catch each other up on everything they’ve found out, Galen sharing that his sister is dating [[Jonah d'Cannith]]. Petr points out he thinks that can’t be a coincidence, yet Galen adds that according to Daphne, she and Jonah were dating long before this group even had a run in with him. 

He goes on to say that he really isn’t sure how to handle this, as he doesn’t want to be the brother who tells his sister’s boyfriend to fuck off, though Lux points out that these are extenuating circumstances considering Jonah has outright said he wants them dead. 

He and Bonzo then briefly explain why they were here at the university, before Lux shows the note he got to Galen, Rydia and Petr, the latter recognising the place that’s mentioned in the note. He shares that it seems to be a bar frequented by shifters, where specific sport events take place as well. It’s located underneath the Cornerstone. 

Considering they have a lot to wrap their heads around, they decide to simply go to dinner that night and see if they can’t figure out everything else the following day. Before dinner, Galen, Lux and Bonzo head to a House Sivis location so they can send some messages. Lux reaches out to Jonah. She tells him, through the House Sivis clerk, that she heard he’s in Sharn and she suggests they meet up at a place called the Gold & White. 

Jonah responds, saying he’s surprised she’s still alive, and that he’s not currently in town, but he will be soon. Lux suggests they meet up when he does get to town, asking him to message her when he gets here, which Jonah seems to agree to. 

Galen confirms dinner plans with his parents for the following day, feeling slightly more at ease now that he knows that Jonah isn’t in town (yet), whereas Bonzo checks for replies from his parents. He finds a letter from his mother, assuring him she’s okay, with some cookies attached. His father hasn’t responded, which he points out to Galen and Lux, who ask if he expected a response.

He explains that he thought his dad was here, as he was supposed to be working on an assignment in Sharn. 

With the messages sent, they rejoin with the others and Rydia quickly reaches out to Esme, asking her about the dress code for that night. Esme assures them there’s no dress code and eventually, the crew find their way to Esme and Lina’s apartment. 

They take an elevator up the building, where they’re met with a dark wooden door. Esme answers after they knock, and they’re invited inside. The apartment has wooden floors, Esme herself walking around barefoot, and is decorated with all sorts of archeological items. There’s plants everywhere, leaving the place brimming with life.

She leads them inside a lounge room, where she offers some drinks, Lux saying that she thinks she speaks for everyone when she says they could use something on the stronger side. A dragonfire brandy is pulled out and soon after, another woman walks in. This is [[Lina]], wearing a blue dress. She has long dreadlocks, decorated with all sorts of beads and rings, wearing large earrings and spectacles. 

![[lina.jpeg]]

She greets Galen by calling him the main competition, which leads to Galen promptly excusing himself and offering to help set the table. As he and Maurice, the man who sometimes helps Lina and Esme around the house, set the table, conversations are had. Lina approaches Lux, mentioning Cyre and the research they’ve been doing into what caused the Mourning. She seems proud that their research will have a profound effect on those who are from the area. 

Esme, in the mean time, speaks to Bonzo. She asks if he’s the one who fixed up the ship, which he says he was, though he had help of the others. She seems impressed with his craftsmanship, though points out that some of the wood seems to literally be roughly chopped jungle wood. Bonzo confirms this, and is therefore glad to hear that Esme says she’s ordered some soarwood, which would let them fix up the ship properly. 

Dinner is served then and everyone moves to the dining room and finds a seat. Galen takes the chance to catch up with his friends, and there’s some small talk to be had before the conversation eventually turns to a more serious subject.

“Do you know the origin of the Wish spell?” Lina asks, and when she’s met with some confusion, she continues to explain. The Wish spell contacts the plane of Dal’Quor and provides a spirit from there that is capable of doing whatever the caster of the Wish spell wants. In Making, they were trying to create a living Wish spell, as that would mean they would get access to unlimited uses of the spell. They tried to bind a Quori spirit to a dragonshard, which obviously seems to have backfired.

![[making.png]]

After Lina shares this, Galen in turn shares some of what happened to him and Rydia, then what happened after they joined the crew and what they have found since. As he’s explaining about the Eye they found, Lux pulls the crystal out of the doorknob, touching it to take it out. As she touches it, there’s suddenly an immense cold, as she’s briefly taken to another plane before being brought back to the present. 

Using Mage Hand, she floats the crystal over to Lina, warning her of what happens when you touch it, though assuring her that it doesn’t seem to actually harm anyone. Lina shares a look with Esme, as if to ask for permission, then touches the stone as her wife says she’d do it anyway. 

She touches it, experiencing the same thing the others did, seeming to find it all quite fascinating. Then, Galen mentions the draconic prophecy, as that is what ties all this together. Lina says she has heard of it, but she’s ‘no Zenobaal’, suggesting that she knows who he is. She explains that she knows he’s a dragon and that he used to be obsessed with the prophecy, but then seemed to lose interest. She doesn’t know where he is however.

The conversation turns back to the Eyes then and as it comes up that one of them can be found in Making, Lina says she has a proposition for Galen as well as the others. She and her organisation have been working on several kinds of magic and one particular thing they’ve been working on is a way to protect those who head into the Mournland. She says they’ve been making headway, and she hopes that the crew will take her up on the offer of going into Making.

They’d be able to find the Eye, maybe, but the expedition needs to be funded and though she trusts Galen, she says that she doesn’t know the others, and so they’d need to undergo some tests before she’d be able to send them. 

The idea of these tests seems to not necessarily sit well with all of the crew, but as they only know of the location of one more Eye and that’s where it is, they do tell Lina they’d likely be interested in that. 

The conversation then briefly turns to House Cannith, Galen mentioning who his sister is dating and asking Esme and Lina if they know House Cannith has a lot of dealings in Sharn. Esme points out they have about as much dealings there as they have everywhere else, as their house, like house Lyrander, has business most everywhere else.  

With dinner coming to an end, they soon say their goodbyes and the crew takes their leave and start making their way through town towards the airship. It’s a beautiful night out, with clear skies, and as they’re walking along Rydia looks up and spots the moon with the slit in it. Lareon, the Eye. Suddenly, she hears cackling laughter all around her and soon finds herself in a familiar cave, a large green snout appearing in the darkness before her. 

“You know I was once like you. Craving understanding. Fruitlessly chasing every clue. To the prophecy in the hopes of mastering it. I have seen all there is to see. I know the stars, the future thunders in my heart. But the prophecy is a cruel, cruel mistress.” 

The others suddenly hear a loud scream behind them. They turn, Rydia having stopped dead in her tracks. Her cloak has fallen away and the maw is ever expanding, something people are beginning to notice. Galen runs towards her, attempting to shake her out of this, but she’s absolutely non responsive. 

When he tries to move her, it proves more difficult than expected as well, as she seems to be resisting. Galen calls out to Lux, asking her to do something. With people all around starting to notice, Lux casts Major Image on Rydia, attempting to overlay an image of ‘normal’ Rydia over this situation. 

The screaming of people seems to die down, as it works, at least for a moment.

Meanwhile, the snout of [[Vvaraak]] moves further into the light. Scratched into the skin are markings, the scales of the dragon long since gone. The markings look like dragonmarks but presented in a maze pattern. “I brought you here to tell you that, you shouldn’t trust the prophecy,” Vvaraak says, Rydia asking him if he has a different one instead. “I will send you on a path, you do not need to know why it is for. Your shattered mind couldn’t take it, but they are coming.” 

Vvaraak crawls forward, the cuts in his flesh becoming more apparent. They are bleeding. “Now you see why I’m no longer the Scaled Apostate. Young one, the Sentinels of the Maze are coming. You’ve seen it, yes? The maze?” Rydia confirms this. “Find me the eyes and as they come we will avert disaster and remake the world.”

“Remake the … okay,” Rydia repeats. 

Back in Sharn, though people are no longer screaming, there are now guards rushing in, responding to the screams. They wear the white and gold of the Sharn Watch, and it seems to be six soldiers, as well as one warforged. Knowing they’re pretty close to the ship, both Lux and Bonzo attempt to teleport Rydia towards Lyrander Tower, but they realise that it might not be her they’re trying to move. Something is putting up a fight, Lux realising that her Dimension Door won’t work and Bonzo’s Vortex Warp spell not taking effect. 

The captain of the guard meanwhile starts approaching Rydia, putting his hand on her shoulder, but Galen manages to stop him. He tells the guard they’ve had a lot to drink that night, Lux using Major Image to have Rydia respond as well, attempting to help sell Galen’s story. 

The warforged approaches them, spreading out it’s arms and telling everyone to calm down. A blue gas comes out of his hands and he successfully manages to charm person both Galen, as well as, somehow, Vvaraak, both of them charmed and finding themselves incapacitated. 

Eager to keep her conversation with [[Vvaraak]] going, Rydia telepathically reaches out to him. He’s not sure what the hell is happening to him. “I knew I took a risk contacting you. Are they here? Have they finally come? Let them…” Rydia says she doesn’t think they’ve come. “What do you know, with your shattered mind? They’re here, I know it!” 

He keeps mentioning that they’re coming, Rydia asking about the Sentinels of the Maze. “The ones that oversee everything, how it connects.” When asked, Vvaraak confirms that it is indeed bad that they’re coming. “If anybody but us gets the majority of those stones… they come. Five pieces, three is enough.” Rydia suggests that she will have to let her friends know about this. 

“They have me in some sort of chokehold, I can’t get you back to where you are from. Where are they? Can you see them?” Rydia says she can only see him, looking around for her friends. “Just you and I here,” she tells Vvaraak, though he doesn’t seem to believe her. “You are deceiving you. It’s that brain of yours, it’s a soup, goddamnit why do I have to be stuck with you. I’m sure they’re coming, they’re coming!”

Back in Sharn, the warforged says this is a warning, urging them to stay calm. Lux tells them they’re calm, they’re just a little drunk and wanting to go home. The guards do seem to calm down a little, though the captain starts walking along the crowds, asking bystanders what happened. He tells the other watch members that the crew is not allowed to leave until they get to the bottom of this. 

The crew continues to try and snap Rydia out of it, Lux attempting to dispel whatever’s taken a hold of Rydia. Petr casts Lesser Restoration on Galen to snap him out of the charmed state, which works. The rest of the soldiers are now questioning the bystanders, who are pointing at Rydia, explaining what they saw. 

Lux tries Dispel Magic again, this time succeeding, interrupting Vvaraak’s rants as Rydia gets ripped away from the cave, finding herself in an illusionary depiction of herself. As she steps out of it, Lux attempts to move it with her to try and keep up the disguise, but isn’t quick enough to make it seem seamless. 

Some people notice and the screams start to rise again…
