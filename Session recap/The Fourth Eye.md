# The Fourth Eye
Considering the question from [[Vyssilithar]], Beck asks what she knows of The Coming along with the Eyes. She says it's one of the paths laid out by the rogue - no other dragon support his theories, but [[Vvaraak]] says that when they tried to make peace with [[Dal'Quor]], it was a mistake to allow the original Eye to be shattered. The fact it's shattered could mean that Dal'Quor or another enemy is approaching, but without the whole and intact Eye of [[Arag]], they won't be able to see any threats coming. Rydia asks if he wants to see it assembled, with Vyssilithar commenting that gender is something of a complex subject for dragons.

Given Vvaraak is considered rogue, Galen asks what the rest of the dragons believe. She explains the future is always in motion and hard to predict - there are no clear signs of the Eyes leading to any more catastrophes. Beck questions the phrase 'any more', and Vyssilithar confirms one of the Eyes was what caused the Mourning. The Eye of Arag split into five when Dal'Quor rejected the original diplomatic offer. Vyssilithar says she doesn't know how they caused the Mourning, interpreting that they were toying with powers they didn't fully understand and caused a catastrophe. The Queen of Cyre instructed those bearing the Mark of Creation to build a weapon - and this project went terribly wrong.

Beck asks if there's any realism to [[Masvirik]]'s Nightmares, with Vyssilithar saying that Masvirik has been in constant contact with [[Rashaak]] for many years, and has deep knowledge of the prophecy. She doesn't know if the dreams are real or not, but there may be glimpse of reality that he learned from Rashaak. Beck asks how they can guarantee they don't cause another Mourning, but Vyssilithar assures them the Eye in [[Haka'thorvak]] was used for centuries with no such mishaps. Those in Making were doing things with the Eye no one should have attempted. However, if they need more help with the Eyes, they could contact a colleague of hers - [[Zenobaal]], a member of the Gold Concord. Galen and Petr recognising this, knowing the Aurum is split into three concords - Gold, Silver and Bronze, with Galen's father being a member of the Silver Concord. Vyssilithar says they'd been able to find Zenobaal in the City of Towers - Sharn.

Rydia asks about the Fourth Eye, Vyssilithar saying that in the original rhyme, the fourth eye is the one in Haka'thorvak. She doesn't know where the rest are. The Eye itself is constantly fluctuating, along with its planar connection. Petr asks if they could use one Eye to find the others, which she says may be possible, but she doesn't know how. Galen confirms the rhyme was the prophecy from Vvaraak, before making a suggestion. "What if the prophecy was meant for us?" He points out the prophecy was written aeons ago, but it could be possible the rhyme refers to where the Eyes are now, Galen pointing out the connection to Making. Vyssilithar recites the [[Draconic Prophecy]] again, Galen realising the last line is also familiar to him - it was one of the phrases he heard Rydia saying towards the end of her catatonic state in Gatherhold. At the time, he took it as a good sign that she was breaking out of whatever loop she'd been stuck in. 

Galen admits he could be wrong, and he's not really one for believing in destiny - however Vvaraak sent Rydia here for a reason. Vyssilithar admits it's fortuitous they arrived. She's seen a vague path of a Disciple of the Rogue arriving at Haka'thorvak, followed by an Aberrant, at which she looks to Beck, and one of the Heirs of Aerenal, at which point she turns to Galen. Vyssilithar admits she doesn't know what it is about him, Galen asking what she's talking about. Aerenal is a continent of elves, and whilst Vyssilithar says propehcy is often vague, she smells something elven about Galen. He insists there's no elven blood in his family, Rydia smelling Galen as well to double check.

Beck points out he's not really an Aberrant, he just has a mark, one that Vyssilithar says doesn't belong to a fully formed power. She explains Aerenal is a plenty busy society from what she's heard, but the elves tend to be perfectionists - to the point where even beyond death, they try to be the best. Beck asks if the Daughters of Sora Kell have any connection to Aerenal, which she says they don't. They rule the lands of Droaam with an iron fist, and are trying to be taken seriously - but they shouldn't. Beck asks about Athelonia, and Vyssilithar says she hasn't seen the Queen Regent for over five hundred years. She says she must be sad, seeing her children going to war and bickering among each other.

Conversation turns to the [[Tome of Vvaraak]], Galen asking why anyone would want it. She says there are plenty of people who revere Vvaraak as a bringer of knowledge, pointedly looking to Petr at this. He's a powerful figure in history, and there's a lot of reasons to want it - there's also plenty of people in the Council of Argonessen who would like to see it destroyed. Beck asks why Rashaak would want to read it, Vyssilithar explaining that he is more vengeful that her - hence why she is the guardian, and he is the soldier. She asks for more details, the party explaining he commanded Rydia to read. Vyssilithar asks about the Tome, using Detect Thoughts to dig into Rydia's mind, telling her she won't break anything. She contemplates for a bit before confirming Rydia does seem to have the Tome with her, although it's difficult to discern prophecy from the gibberish around it. Vyssilithar says she has some of the verses in her library, and what she hears in Rydia are either known, or just gibberish.

Vyssilithar withdraws from Rydia, explaining that they gave up using the Eye after the corruption took over Rashaak. However, if they want to see it, they're welcome to proceed. As they do, they can hear something pounding on the door, Beck working out this is likely Jondar. Beck tells her that probably means Rashaak is here. Vyssilithar tells them the tomb is through a door on the other side of the room, and she will take care of Rashaak. Five of the gargoyles from the roof come to life, flying towards her as she places a medallion into a divot on a plinth. The roof twists open, the gargoyles flying out of the temple before she closes the roof behind them. Vyssilithar explains that once they're in place, they can rebuild the Dawnshard network, the [[Poison Dusk]] having brought enough Kyber Crystal to replenish the shards. A surge of blood leaves the basin, Vyssilithar assuring them the first shard is already restored, and Rashaak should calm down once she completes her work.

The group head across the central room towards a door, the doors opening for them as they approach. It leads to another curved hallway, blood running along the floor with a number of draconic reliefs set into the floor. There's daylight pouring into the hall through a crack in the ceiling, with a number of sarcophogi at the sides of the hall. There's a large door at the other end of the hall, a draconic face engraved into the stone, with "Here rests the last Speaker" engraved above it. As they progress, Galen notices some of the sarcophogi are open, with patches of tar staining the floor. Rydia begins to joke it might have been warm in there before giving up the attempt, Beck trying Detect Magic. He senses a strong necrotic energy from the tar, which they agree to avoid as they progress carefully.

They head forward, the entire party caught by surpise as a spirit of a Dragonborn appears beside them, clearly launching themselves towards Bonzobur. Moving quickly, Rydia moves around him and uses her new Telekinetic powers to push it away from him before it can possess him. Two more spirits appear, the group fighting them off and managing to disperse the form of the ghosts. As they do so, two masses of the tar begin to move out of the shadows, approaching the group and sizziling as they cross the blood streaming across the floor. They fight back the assault, Petr putting up a Wall of Fire to try and keep them away from the group. However, Beck eventually falls victim to one, being pulled through the fire as the tar enters Beck, causing him to cast Dimension Door and return back to the main room of the temple, and the massive Dawnshard there. Appearing in the blood pool, Vyssilithar asks what he's doing, Beck managing to choke out that Masvirik seems to be trying to get in, his influence behind the actions of the spirits, which have been corrupted into this state. As the others take care of the remaining tar, Galen runs after Beck, telling Vyssilithar what happened. She then casts Protection From Evil and Good on Beck, the tar expelled from Beck and falling into the blood pool. Galen takes the opportunity, shooting at it as the tar disintegrates into the blood, although Vyssilithar seems visibly confused at him using bullets on it.

Galen moves over to help Beck out of the pool, the two returning to the rest of the group in the hallway. They're soon joined by Vyssilithar, who offers to guide them to the tomb in case of any further mishaps.
