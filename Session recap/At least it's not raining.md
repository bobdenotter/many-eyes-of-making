# At least it's not raining
**Aka: This is a safe space**

The first thing Rydia does upon discovering Galen isn’t there, is send a message to Beck. She asks him to come down to their room, which Beck does, clad in his pyjama’s, groggily taking in the room. Rydia asks him if he sees what she’s seeing, which Beck does confirm; he too sees an empty bed, with traces of blood as well as a glowing pocket watch.

As soon as Beck confirms it’s real, Rydia sends a message to Mortem Pent, asking him where ‘he’ is. Pent responds with confusion, unsure who just messaged him, but as Rydia clarifies she’s looking for Galen, he seems confused to find that Galen is gone, and that his pocket watch has been left behind. 

Beck takes a look at the pocket watch, picking it up, before momentarily leaving Rydia on her own as he goes to wake Petr and Bonzo. He asks Petr to check up on Rydia as he goes to find Bonzo, asking him to take a look at the pocketwatch. Bonzo deduces that some sort of transportation magic was used, but also realises that the watch is still attuned to Galen, which should mean he’s still alive.

Petr goes to find Rydia, but is almost instantly pushed back out of the room as Rydia shoves him out and messages Esme. She slips into Daelkyr for a moment as she tells Esme the tower isn’t as safe as she said it would be. Esme responds with confusion, having only just woken up, but when Rydia explains that Galen is missing, she says she’ll come to the tower and help.

Rydia then walks out the room, addressing Petr now, asking him if he has any other suggestions of people who she can try and message. Petr asks her if she’s tried messaging Galen himself, to which Rydia stares at him for a moment before trying just that. She can feel that her magic is working, but something seems to block it, meaning she can’t reach Galen.

The two of them have moved up to the deck by now, and Petr starts theorizing what might’ve happened and why Galen might not be responding. One of his theories is that he might be dead, the mere suggestion of which is enough to make Rydia sit down on the floor and curl up into a ball. Realising he might’ve said something wrong, Petr sits down next to her and apologies, telling her he’s sure Galen’s fine. He comments on how at least it isn’t raining, trying to convince Rydia to take a more positive look at the situation.

Bonzo and Beck soon then join them on the deck, sharing what they’ve found, which seems to put Rydia at least a little at ease. Esme soon arrives as well, sharing that she spoke to the staff that were present in the tower overnight. One person seems to have heard something in the middle of the night, but they dismissed it as someone slamming a door and didn’t think to inspect it.

About an hour and a half passes of the group sharing theories and looking around, Bonzo fiddling with the pocket watch, until Esme eventually suggests that maybe Rydia should try messaging Galen again. She says she already tried that, but still does try again and this time, she actually gets through. When she asks Galen where he is, he simply responds with “I’m outside”.

They all rush down to the elevator to meet Galen, Rydia ahead of the group and when they get outside, they do indeed run into him. He looks somewhat worse for wear and is strangely dressed in what appears to be a thick winter coat. Rydia greets him with a kiss and a slap to the face and Galen is then quick to suggest they head back inside, where he says he’ll explain what happened. 

He gives Esme the cliffnotes version of what happened, as she has to get back to work and, once they’re back aboard the ship, he suggest they make some tea before he tells the rest of the group a little more. Bonzo hands him his pocket watch back, which he shuts and as he does so, it stops glowing. 

Tea is made, before Galen starts explaining what happened: he was transported all the way to the Lhazaar Principalities. 

Galen asks if the others are familiar with Erandis Vol. The name sounds familiar to most of the group, as they’ve heard of Erandis before; they’re the child of Vvaraak and a female elf the dragon met in Aerenal. Half dragon, half elf. Galen’s research also unveiled her to be a figure of myth, rumored to be the last bearer of the Mark of Death. 

Galen says the house got wiped out a few hundred years ago, before going on to say he met Erandis. “She wanted me to break her out,” Galen says, but before he gets to explain much more, there’s a loud knock at the hangar bay. An unfamiliar voice calls out: “Apologies, my name is Jeremiah, I am here on the behalf of the Exalted Order of Aureon; may I please have a word with all of you?” 

Beck attempts to check in with everyone considering what they’re telling this guy, Galen instead asking for gloves. He holds up his left hand, which is completely black and withered, black veins running across it; yet another thing they don’t get to ask questions about considering Jeremiah is right outside. 

Bonzo calls out to Jeremiah to say they’ll be right out, Galen excusing himself to get cleaned up some more, Rydia following after him as Beck heads to the door to go let Jeremiah in. He’s a human man, tall, broad in the shoulders but otherwise lanky. Well dressed, shoulder length brown hair with intense sideburns and black eyes with seemingly no irises. 

He says it took a bit of doing to get up here, asking if everything’s well. Then asks if they know why he’s here, which Beck confirms they do. He asks if now is a good time, Beck telling him it really isn’t, but inviting him in anyway. He leads Jeremiah onto the ship and into the kitchen, where Bonzo and Petr are still gathered. 

Petr offers the man something to drink, explaining in detail how he likes to prepare his coffee, managing to stall the psychiatrist for a good ten to fifteen minutes, buying Galen and Rydia some time to talk and get Galen looking somewhat more presentable. 

Galen apologises to Rydia, which she tells him not to do, before asking him about his hand. “The reason all this shit has been happening with me is because I have the blood of Erandis Vol,” Galen tells her. “And it would appear that the Karrnathys are holding her prisoner, so she sent someone to go and find someone with her blood and get her out of there.” He goes on to explain he was shot with a teleportation arrow or something, and that’s how he ended up there. 

“This was considered a gift,” he adds, holding up his blackened hand. “This was the price for teleporting back,” he holds up his other hand, which is also injured. The gift was a thank you for his hard work and Galen is fairly certain no healer in the world can fix his hand. “I think I know what that feels like,” Rydia comments, before walking over and giving Galen a hug. 

He goes on to say he didn’t have much time to do anything about what happened; he got dropped into an ocean, had to swim to shore and then he had to free Erandis. Not without asking her a lot of questions first though. He goes on to say he promises he’s as fine as he can be, and he’ll explain more later, but the doctor is here now and they should deal with that. 

“For what it’s worth, I don’t think I’ll be getting kidnapped again, I think Erandis will just message me or just show up,” he adds, to which Rydia says she hopes it’s the latter. Galen in turn urges her to consider that Erandis might have kidnapped him; her blood is also the reason he’s still alive. “And apparently Vvaraak would have an opinion about hurting someone with his daughter’s blood.” 

Rydia considers this explains why it was weird when she tasted Galen’s blood, deciding not to linger too long on the thought that the person-who’s-a-part-of-her’s daughter is apparently part of Galen somehow. The two of them share a kiss despite acknowledging it’s weird and then Beck knocks on the door. 

Looking over Galen, Beck suggests he can heal him up a little, Galen as per usual insisting he’s fine despite mentioning he got beat up by a bunch of statues. Galen grabs Rydia’s hand as they head towards the kitchen, Beck healing Galen a little regardless as he follows after the two of them. 

The moment they walk into the kitchen, Rydia telepathically apologises to Petr for before and with the group all gathered now, Jeremiah takes them all in, detecting that there seems to be some tension amongst all of them. 

Jeremiah introduces himself to Rydia and Galen, as he’s already done to the rest of the group. “My name is Jeremiah Coulin, and I’m here to take a look at your group. See how you feel about each other, see how you work together, and so on.” He explains his employer simply wants to know who they’re going to be working with. 

He starts things of with somewhat of a broad question: “What do you feel the purpose of your group is?” There’s a moment of silence, some looks are shared and then Beck simply says that they hope to stop bad things from happening. Jeremiah rightfully points out that’s a broad concept, asking them more specifically about how they deal with confrontations. Do they choose violence or they try to be more diplomatic about it? 

He continues his line of questioning, asking about the group dynamic and who plays what part within the crew. They share the roles they play aboard the ship, which leads to Jeremiah asking Galen how he feels about having been thrusted into some more of a leadership role. Galen shares he’s learning to accept it. When asked, he says he’d do his best to keep the crew safe if something were to happen to the captain. 

All the while, a magical quill is scribbling away on a magical clipboard, taking notes as the conversation goes on. 

The line of questioning turns to Cyre, Jeremiah having been told it’s where Beck is from, so he asks if he has any reservations about going there. Beck shares that he’s not from that specific area in Making, admitting that he is curious about Making and about the research they’ll be doing. He adds that, considering he, like many others, lost people, the Mournland brings back painful memories, but he thinks he can handle that. 

Jeremiah then changes the subject, mentioning the Architects of Ruin. Everyone except Beck does a bad job hiding they know exactly who those are, and Bonzo is quick to explain that he used to be part of them. He admits he has mixed feelings about it; he made friends in the war that he was fond of, yet he’s also aware that the things he made contributed to a lot of hurt. 

The conversation turns to what is good and what is bad, Rydia turning the question around on Jeremiah. She asks him if Jeremiah himself would make the sacrifice of this group if it meant all the needed information was gathered, to which Jeremiah admits that he would make that call. 

Now that they’re asking Jeremiah questions, Beck has one as well and he asks if there’s any particular reason they have to be sound of mind in order to head into the Mournland. Jeremiah shares that, whilst he hasn’t been himself, he has heard stories of those who returned from these types of missions, and they were certainly affected by what they saw there. He’d go as far as to call it post traumatic stress responses. 

This prompts Beck to share that they’ve seen plenty of bad things and when Jeremiah asks if they’d be willing to share, Rydia uses Encode Thoughts, literally handing Jeremiah a memory of what happened to her when she touched the book. Beck also shares that not too long ago, they were all forced to see their own worst nightmares, some of the group adding that these nightmares almost seemed like premonitions of bad things to happen. 

The conversation then turns to other things, as Galen’s father is mentioned, and he’s asked about that relationship. Jeremiah, like many people in Sharn and the rest of Khorvaire, is aware of Galen’s last name and what family he’s part of. Galen shares that his relationship with his father is fine, except his father doesn’t like the career path he chose. 

By now having noted that Galen keeps hiding his hands under the table, Jeremiah winds up asking about it and Galen shows it. When asked, he insists that what caused this won’t affect the mission they’re about to go on. Jeremiah then, not for the first time, asks if there’s anything the group would like to share that might be important for the mission. 

Not sure about how much they want to share, Beck joins Rydia, who has moved over to the stove to prepare some cookies. He asks her if she thinks they should share with Jeremiah that they know other groups are interested in the area, which starts a bit of a back and forth between the two of them and Galen, Rydia facilitating a telepathic conversation between Beck and Galen. 

Though Galen doesn’t quite agree, Beck still speaks up when Jeremiah starts picking up on this conversation. He shares, as vaguely as possible, that they’re aware of other groups who have an interest in the area of Cyre they’re going to. He doesn’t share how they know this, nor does he share what these groups are. When asked about the latter, he looks over at Galen, which prompts Jeremiah to use Detect Thoughts on Galen.

He’s met with an image of a lady in gold and black, as well as the image of a very pale elf with slit wrists. Jeremiah then concludes the interview, thanking them all for their cooperation and Galen offers to walk him out. 

As the two of them walk to the door, Galen asks him if he got what he was looking for, asking him if the probing in his mind was really necessary. Jeremiah says he did think it was necessary, though he goes on to assure Galen that he doesn’t think that what was shared will have any bad effect on whether or not they will be invited on the mission. 

They say their good-byes and as Galen heads back onto the ship to join the others, Jeremiah finds his way across town to his office. Unbeknownst to the crew, he’s welcomed to his office by his mindflayer assistant, who tells him that his 2 o’clock is already inside and ready for their appointment.
