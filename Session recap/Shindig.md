# Shindig
With the therapist having taken his leave, the crew turn to Galen, asking him for the more extended explanation he’d promised them before. He starts at the beginning, detailing how some elven woman snuck into his room and then shot him with what turned out to be a teleporting dart of sorts. Before they shot him, this person told him not to trust anyone, and to find the fortress.

He found himself transported into an arctic ocean in the north of the Lhazaar Principalities, and forced to swim to shore. There, he found a small town where he asked around and was told that if he were to take a ship back to the mainland, it would be a good two to three weeks before the next ship would leave. With not much of a choice, Galen sought out the fortress, which is where he found Erandis Vol. 

She was being held captive by the Sanguine Council, against her will. From what he gathered, they were trying to turn her into a god and had been holding her captive for a very long time. Galen’s not sure why they’re trying to do this. 

He goes on to explain that the Sanguine Council still has a part of her in the Lhazaar Principalities, the last ‘real’ piece of her. The council had been messing with her so long that her soul was split and they need to find the other pieces of her soul before they can continue their plan. Galen thinks he freed the real part of Erandis: a girl who got caught up in a bunch of politics who didn’t deserve any of this happening to her. 

Beck asks if her parts are the eyes, which Galen doesn’t think they are. He goes on to say that he asked Erandis what she wanted. She told him she wants to finish her father’s work, take revenge on the Line of Jhaelian and then she wants to die. She’s been kept alive a couple of hundred years by now. 

Thinking back, Beck recalls that Jhaelian is the maiden name of Athelonia. He also knows that only two of her children remain; Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn, of Aundair and King Kaius ir'Wynarn the third of Karrnath, meaning that’s three people that Erandis wants to kill. Athelonia favoured her oldest daughter, the one who ruled Cyre, which her other children did not agree with and that’s said to have been the spark that caused the last war. 

Bonzo then asks who Erandis’ father is, Galen confirming that it’s Vvaraak. He adds that Erandis seems to want to do her fathers’ things first: finding the Eyes. The crew isn’t sure if that means she’s on their side or not. Galen says he asked Erandis what she thought Vvaraak wants with the eyes; she said that they think the Sentinels of the Maze are coming and when they do that’s bad. 

To stop that, they want to repeat what happened to Dal’Quor, except now with Xoriat. Get the eyes, sever the connection to the plane, which would solve the problem. Vvaraak was convinced the danger is very real and Erandis seems to believe the same thing, so she’s looking for the Eyes. 

With Rydia having shared what Vvaraak was like the last time she spoke to him, Beck asks if Erandis seemed more sane than her father. Galen says she seemed more sane than her father, adding that she died pretty young for an elf and she just seemed sad and angry and like she got caught up in things that weren’t fair on her. 

“I trust her a lot more than most of the other people that are trying to get to the Eyes,” Galen adds, Beck pointing out they don’t know the reasoning of all of the others who are after them. Galen says that he knows why the Council wants the Eyes; they need them to find the other parts of Erandis’ soul. To do that, they only need a single Eye. He adds that this means they need to find all of them. 

Rydia points out they have an Eye, Beck asking if she’s suggesting they should find these parts of the souls first. Bonzo agrees it seems important to keep the Eyes out of the hands of the people. Galen then shares what else he found out about the Eyes. Erandis shared her knowledge of the Eyes, confirming that one Eye is in Making, another is in the Mror Holds and a third is on a pirate island in the Lhazaar Principalities. 

The fifth, apparently even Vvaraak himself didn’t know where it was. Petr adds that he thinks it makes Erandis more trustworthy that she shared this information. Galen says he told her some of what they know, Erandis seeming surprised that he knew a lot about these things. 

He goes on to say that her agent was told to look for someone with the blood of Erandis Vol, Galen mentioning the dream he had and adding that he thinks this is what they did when they experimented on him. “There are supposedly sixteen others,” he adds, though he doesn’t know much else about them. “As long as we’re alive, Erandis doesn’t die.” Beck asks if this means they all have parts of her soul, whereas Rydia is concerned about the implication of Erandis wanting to die and Galen and the sixteen others apparently keeping her alive. 

Beck suggests that maybe there’s a way to take the blood out, Galen pointing out that’s low on his list of priorities. He’s more worried about the council and the Eyes and he’s worried about the rest of them. Petr brings up the hand, Galen saying she asked him to shove it into a bowl of blood and he didn’t think about it too much at the time. 

She said it was a gift. Beck points out that ‘not really thinking about it much at the time’ doesn’t really sound like Galen, Galen saying his priority was to simply get back. Bonzo then asks him how he feels about having the hand now, Galen saying he doesn’t think he can undo it, so he’ll just have to live with it. 

Rydia tells Galen that if he wants to hide it, there’ll be moments he’ll forget to do so, saying those might be the worst moments. She adds that she doesn’t mind the hand. Galen says he’s pretty sure it does something, but he doesn’t know what yet, Bonzo wondering what the ‘gift’ part of the hand is. He tries to explain to the others how the hand feels, Petr comparing it to his staff, except you can’t put a hand down. 

They agree to keep looking for the Eyes, as well as maybe the soul parts. Galen points out Erandis Vol might pop up next to him if she does, then asking if the others are sure they want him to come to the Mournland. “It is apparently somewhat dangerous for you to be around me,” he says, the others asking him to explain. “If things go wrong, it’s going to be difficult.” 

Beck points out that’s incredibly fucking vague, Rydia agreeing, so Galen mentions the thing that keeps happening around him. “The thing you don’t want to talk about and claim is fine when it clearly isn’t?” Beck asks, Galen confirming that is indeed what he’s talking about. “The souls of the people that die around me get trapped in my blood. Anyone.” Rydia says she thinks she might be safe from that, saying she thinks his blood wouldn’t want her. 

Though they acknowledge the risk, the crew says they want Galen around regardless, Petr pointing out that the alternative of leaving Galen behind doesn’t seem ideal either. Galen says he expected that answer, but he wanted them to know regardless, not wanting to put them in a dangerous situation like he’s done to others before. Beck points out that if something happens to them, it won’t be Galen’s fault. 

They ask Galen if there’s anything else. “The dragon in Q’barra said I’m the heir of Aerenal because of my blood, Rydia is apparently heir to a throne in Argonessen, uh … Oh and apparently aberrant dragonmarks are connected to Xoriat somehow so ... good luck with that. Oh and we met a dragon in Q’barra.” The others are mostly confused about the last statement, Galen saying that the books they think they read were instead a dragon. He explains their memories were wiped, as the dragon didn’t want Masvirik to know she was there. 

The conclusion seems to be that they keep doing what they’re doing, they just have more information now and everything seems more urgent. Beck asks if the Sanguine Council knows what they now know, if Erandis told them anything, but Galen doesn’t think that she did. With nothing really having changed, Beck points out they have a gala to attend.   

Before they head out to get some outfits, Bonzo offers Galen to take a look at his hand. The hand is cold. It doesn’t look like much, but there’s thick black veins and he can easily feel Galen’s pulse. There’s clearly some strange necromancy going on. It seems this was made by hemocraft, by very ancient rituals that don’t overlap with Bonzo’s knowledge of arcane magic. His best guess is that Galen looks to be a living phylactery, which are used to prolong life and contain a great wealth of magical abilities by storing and burning up souls. 

“So, I’m burning up people’s lives for this,” Galen concludes, recalling that it’s mostly been souls of his enemies, but there’s at least two good souls in there: the two other members of the Golden Grin who died. He excuses himself for a moment, retreating to his bunk, Rydia following close behind as the rest of the crew remains on deck. 

In the privacy of their quarters, the two share a hug. Rydia urges Galen to take all the time he needs, trying to draw his attention to nicer things; outfit shopping and the gala tonight. She then asks him if he’s going to wear a glove, telling him she knows what it’s like to feel like there’s something to hide. “The only one around me who didn’t make me feel like that, was you.” 

Galen points out he knows what these parties and these people are like; they’re going to talk. “But part of me is really done with running.” They agree to make it easy for the people at the party to gossip about something, Rydia saying that if Galen goes without gloves, she won’t wear her mask. “No more running,” they agree. 

Changing the topic, Galen says he probably murdered Kassandra and Helgir. “So I have the tusk and the hair and you have the souls,” Rydia summarises, though Galen adds he’s not sure their souls are still there. She says it seems like Galen has it worse than her, adding that she doesn’t want that for him. They talk some more, agreeing neither of them will let the other die. 

“I’m in this for you, you’re in this for me, I think, fuck everyone else. Well, except for the rest of the crew,” Rydia concludes, before saying they should go shopping. They join up with the others on the deck of the ship and they head out to pick up their outfits. 

After picking up the outfits and spending the night having some food and getting ready, they’re eventually picked up by Esme and Lina at around 9 in the evening. Meeting the two women downstairs, they’re met with the sight of a floating gondola ride, adorned with a golden masthead of a kraken. Glowing fire can be seen through the soarwood of the gondola and everyone gets aboard their ride.

The ride to the gala takes them up, further than they’ve been before. They pass through some clouds, all the way up to Skyway, where they’re met with the sight of numerous floating villas. The gondola takes them to a massive house that looks almost more like a cathedral, where many other guests are arriving, most by flying carpet.

One other ride stands out; a flying carriage with no wheels, pulled forward by four horses with flaming silver manes of hair. This ostentatious vehicle moves past all the other ones, making its way to the front of the line that’s formed. As the carriage comes to a stop, a family of four emerges, three of them dressed in white and one of the daughters dressed in black, though all clothing is adorned with silvery accents. 

Unfamiliar with who this might be, Beck turns to Lina and Esme, who tell him that’s the Sensos family. He recognises the name as that being the councilman who is so strongly opposed to shifters, the one who’s part of the Silver Flame. 

As the crew join the line with everyone else, they look around, trying to spot some of the Cyrian families they might want to talk to. Bonzo recognises the head of the Talan family, Derzin Talan, pointing him out to the others as a person of interest. Meanwhile, Rydia is approached by some people also in line, who compliment her on her costume, unaware that the maw is not a costume at all. 

The line keeps moving forward and as they get to the entrance, the names of Lina and Esme are announced, with the crew named simply as their consorts. Making their way inside, they look around, taking in all the other people there with them. Bonzo recognises Lord Zolan, who he met with not too long ago and as Petr looks around, he recognises Ilyra Boromar. He’s only met her once before, but she’s clearly related to the Boromar clan. 

Galen and Rydia spot a group of gentleman, amongst which they recognise Merrix d’Cannith, pointing him out to Beck as well. Rydia also spots the two daughters of the Sensos family they saw emerge from the carriage not long ago, now having taken to the dance floor. 

Beck shares what he knows of Merrix d’Cannith with the others; though he’s part of the same family as Jonah, they’re on somewhat opposing sides of things. After checking in with Lina about what they can and can’t share with potential benefactors, Beck points out he’d be interested in speaking to Merrix, if only to gauge his reaction to hearing about the mission.

As Petr finds his way to the bar and orders some dark ale (instead of the mulled wine he requested), Beck detours by the orchestra. Managing to talk them into letting him play with them for a moment, he suggests a slightly sadder version of the Cyrian anthem, playing with the orchestra until the song is finished. He then excuses himself and, having caught Merrix’s attention, goes to speak with the man.

Merrix recognises him, though he doesn’t recall Beck’s name, which he’s happy to give. When Merrix asks about Jonah, Beck informs him Jonah’s not in town for another week and also shares he no longer works for him. Merrix complains about Jonah, mentioning that his antics in Gatherhold almost meant that Merrix’s invite to this gala got retracted; he goes as far as to call Jonah a coward for not showing up here. 

He then asks Beck why he’s here, so Beck explains about the mission to the Mournland, saying he thinks it might be interesting for Merrix as well. Merrix shares that House Cannith already has some expeditions into the Mournland itself, and hence he can’t really be a benefactor for this mission, but he’s happy to introduce Beck to some people who might be willing to help. 

Meanwhile, Petr has approached Ilyra, who doesn’t seem to really recognise him. He attempts to tell her about the mission, but soon loses her interest. On the other side of the room, Bonzo spots Zolan again, who’s smoking a cigar near the balcony. He seeks the man out, asking him if he’s a little less busy than he was before. Zolan says that he is and is happy to hear Bonzo out. 

Bonzo explains the situation again, mentioning Jodd and his plans and how the Architects are involved. Zolan says that he looked into the situation a little already and that he’s been trying to get the Brelish King involved as well. He told the Sharn Council already, but the council members didn’t find it an important enough matter. 

He’s since gotten an audience with the king, who promised to look into it and said that soldiers would be dispatched to Kennrun. Bonzo asks if there’s anything else he can do to help, explaining that he feels personally betrayed by Jodd’s actions. When he says he has knowledge on Kennrun, Argoth as well as Jodd’s plans, Zolan seems pleased by this and says he’ll set up a meeting with the Brelish intelligence agency, the Dark Lanterns. There, Bonzo can share his knowledge. 

Bonzo gives Zolan his information so that he can reach him, before he changes the subject to their mission. Zolan unfortunately doesn’t know anyone who he thinks can help with the mission. 

During all this, Galen and Rydia have taken to the dance floor, enjoying their time at the gala. The two Sensos daughters are also still there, dancing closeby. Rydia suggests they should steal the show a little, casting Shadow of Moil to draw more attention to their dancing, which seems to work. It also seems to upset one of the daughters, who calls Rydia out for using magic that isn’t illusionary. 

When Rydia doesn’t seem impressed, she rants about being one of the Daughters of Prophecy, but both Galen and the woman’s sister mitigate and the two girls soon move away from the dance floor. Possa, the sister in the dark dress, drops her sister, Thiria, off with her parents and that seems to deflate the situation. 

Beck meanwhile finds himself introduced to Merrix d’Cannith’s ‘boys club’, Merrix pointing out Jamal Vilroy in particular, saying he might be interested in this. Beck speaks to the man, who does seem interested in the mission, but also seems somewhat distracted. Trying to see what Vilroy is looking at, Beck realises he’s watching the scene on the dance floor unfold. 

When asked, Vilroy shares that he’s not a big fan of the Sensos family, to which Beck explains that he’s friends with the two people on the dance floor who seem to be part frustrating the Sensos daughter. This perks Vilroy’s interest and he suggests a wager to Beck; if he and his friends can make the daughters (and maybe also the dad) look somewhat ridiculous, he’ll be sure to fund at least part of this mission. 

Agreeing to this, Beck excuses himself from the conversation with Vilroy, making his way over to Rydia and Galen and explaining the situation. None of them are really sure how to do this, but Beck suggests that Thiria seems to care greatly about who gets the most attention on the dance floor, which leads to the suggestion of a dance off of sorts. 

Rydia telepathically informs Bonzo and Petr about the plan, who gather at the bar and scheme some intervention measures as Beck approaches Thiria, asking her for a dance. She agrees and the two of them join Galen and Rydia on the dance floor. Beck engages in some small talk with Thiria, who shares a little about her family as well as the Silver Flame.

She even ‘shows’ him that she’s a daughter of prophecy, casting a spell without saying a word, though Beck shakes of most of the effects of it. The dance off ensues, with Rydia and Galen soon notably getting more attention and this frustrating Thiria to the point that she pushes Beck away and goes to complain to her father. 

Her father, Sorik Sensos, approaches, asking his daughter what’s wrong as his eyes flash in as similar fashion to how Thiria’s flashed when she used her magic on Beck. He casts Calm Emotions, which calms his daughter down and also affects Galen, though he’s mostly glad to still be enjoying this party with Rydia. As Sorik and Thiria move away from the dance floor, Beck uses Mage Hand to trip the daughter, which works. 

His magic goes unnoticed by most, except for Thiria’s mother, who spots him from across the room. He looks away, having seem what kind of magic this family is capable of, but that doesn’t stop her from approaching him. She asks him what that was, with Beck still looking away, explaining it was just a silly wager and he meant no harm by it. 

When the woman’s quiet for a moment, he adds that her daughter was the one being rude, to which she responds by saying that her daughters, her husband, and she herself can do whatever they want. As Beck chances a glance up at the woman, her look shifts and he suddenly finds himself looking at his wife. Shaking it off as best as he can, he nods and then slinks back into the crowd. 

Right at that moment, a late guest is announced. Lady Yvagri and her consort, which is a name that’s unfamiliar to most of the crew, but as Galen looks up, he recognises Saedra, the pale elven woman he saw in Gatherhold and Q’barra with her golden mask on. He only saw her actual face in a dream. Beck moves through the crowd towards Vilroy, checking in with him, glad to find the man promises a 5000 gold check for the mission. He introduces Vilroy to Lina as Saedra and her consort, an almost equally pale man, approach the dance floor.

As the consort excuses himself to head to the bar, Saedra remains close to the dance floor, staring ominously at Galen.
