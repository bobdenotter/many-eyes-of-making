# Manipulation & Confession
After their discussion on what to do with the pocket watch, the crew decide to seek out the Sensos family. Galen knows that the Aurum concords operate out of the clifftop district, so they head there to see if they can find Sorik there. 

The location seems to be made mostly out of marbel and is decorated with banners that show eight interlocking rings, representing the bronze, silver, gold and platinum concords. They’re greeted by an older female half-elf, who tells that she’d normally be hesitant to share personal information of Aurum members, but as the Sensos family are fairly public figures, she gives them the information they need.

She tells them to look for a big house surrounded by the clouds, sharing that one of the more upper class skycoach drivers will know where the location is. Before they take their leave, Beck asks her if she knows who Zenobaal is, but the half-elf seems to not recognise the name. 

The crew head back outside and find a skycoach driver who knows where the Sensos house is. He takes them up to the Skyway, where they’re dropped off at a round platform surrounded by pillars. Each of the twelve pillars seems to have a nest atop it, which they later see have massive eagles in them. 

They see a somewhat otherworldly building in the distance and a figure approaches them, seemingly walking across the couch. They recognise the mother of the Sensos family, who is completely clad in white and greets them, seemingly surprised to see the group. She welcomes them inside regardless, asking them to wait in the antechamber as she goes to see if her husband has time to speak to them. 

The room they wait in is decorated with numerous paintings depicting heroic figures, locked in the heat of battle. From the antechamber they can see three staircases, one leading up to what seems to be a heavily locked door and two that are leading down. She heads down one of the staircases and returns not long after with Sorik Sensos in tow. He’s also dressed in white.

He seems equally surprised to see the group, but though Galen apologises for intruding, he says he doesn’t mind and that this just means it’ll be easier for them to set up the meeting they discussed. Galen mentions that they’re here with another reason as well, explaining who the pocket watch is linked to and offering it to Sorik, in case he’s interested in an item that might lure out members of the Sanguine council. 

Sorik seems interested, but suggests that considering the watch’s properties, it might be safer to store it in the chapel of the White Flame. He offers to take the crew there and they watch as a wall seemingly disappears in mist, revealing a cathedral behind it. As they follow Sorik and his wife, Amira, inside, he calls over one of the priests, a man called Devan. Sorik briefly explains the pocket watch to Devan, who casts a spell to take a look at the watch for himself.

His suggestion is putting the watch into a lead lined box for now and he’s given the watch for safe keeping. 

The crew then walks with Sorik as he changes the subject to the meeting they wanted to have with the rest of the golden Aurum. He suggests a date, but Beck tells him that they’ll already be on their mission to the Mournland then. Sorik says that the Golden Aurum meets every third day of the week and Beck suggests they can simply message him when they return from their mission.

He then asks Sorik if Zenobaal will be present at these meetings as well, Sorik asking him where he heard that name. His demeanour seems to change and he asks the group to walk with him, leading them out of the cathedral and downstairs. As they pass through the antechamber again, Galen notices that the heavily locked door has black gunk on it with eyes in it. 

They’re led to an office where Galen, Rydia and Beck notice that a lot of the books in the bookcases are written in draconic. Sorik admits that he’s Zenobaal, asking who told them who he was. Galen says they went to Q’barra, Beck specifying they were in Haka’torvak.  “Was it Rashaak or Vyssilithar?” Galen shares that it was the latter, though only he remembers that it was her, as she erased everyone else’s memories of meeting her and made them think they read the information in books instead. 

Galen goes on to say that they’re looking for the Eyes, which Zenobaal says is dangerous. When he says this, his demeanour seems to change again, and it’s almost like he’s speaking to someone else. Rydia casts Detect Thoughts, picking up on a second presence just outside the door. She recognises it as Amira, though there’s something strange going on; her brain waves seem to be the same as her husband’s, as if one is controlling the other. 

Rydia shares this with the rest of the group telepathically, which prompts Petr to throw up his symbiotic entity as Beck asks: “So which one of you is Zenobaal?” 

Amira appears in the doorway at that question, though she doesn’t look quite like herself. Transformed into a feline creature, with a distinct third eye on her forehead, she speaks with numerous voices as she tells her husband it’s time to send their guests home. 

Combat ensues, during which Zenobaal transforms into a dragon and calls his daughters to join in the fight as well. With what Rydia shared earlier, the crew soon figures out that it’s Amira controlling her husband and they target her. Though both Galen and Rydia get knocked down, they manage to defeat Amira, which breaks her hold on Zenobaal. Though Thiria and Possa still seem upset about what just happened to their mother, Zenobaal manages to calm them down and things calm down after that. 

The crew apologises for murdering his wife, to which Zenobaal in turn apologises profusely to them for putting them in danger. When asked, he tells the group he’s known his wife for twenty years and she steered him away from his original life’s work; the prophecy. He’d been investigating the draconic prophecy and was close to a conclusion, at which point she stopped him.

His conclusion that the prophecy was bullshit. That being said, Vvaraak was still right. Sorik thinks that the prophecy was a way for the Daelkyr to keep us chasing our own tails. This was to keep Argonessen from getting involved. He thinks Amira might’ve been a deep agent working for the Daelkyr. 

He adds that he feels like he’s been sleeping for the last twenty years and isn’t the most coherent right now. “The connection needs to be severed. They eyes of Chronepsis are always watching, especially when dragons are concerned that are doing research.” He then asks if the crew know if anyone else is after the Eyes, to which they tell him that the Sanguine Council, as well as Athelonia are after them. He once again apologises, then escorts the group out so they can be picked up again by a skycoach.

After Zenobaal takes his leave, Galen shares something that Vyssilithar told him. “The empty vessel shall inherit the throne.” He adds that Erandis thought that this was the throne of Argonessen and apparently Rydia is set to inherit that throne. Argonessen is a continent of fifty thousand dragons and these are the people that Daelkyr wants to make sure don’t get involved. 

Zenobaal then rejoins the group briefly after having calmed down his daughters. Tells them that though he thinks the prophecy is bullshit, it still has the potential to tell them about the future. It is essentially a string of ‘if / else’ sentences. The origins of the prophecy are a puppet master thing; they try to get people to do something, but the predictions can still tell people something. Zenobaal quotes some of the ‘agreed upon’ prophecy:

If the crownlands of Wynarn get consumed by mist, the scaled apostate will show himself.

If his gospel is opened under the light of a waxing moon, a new herald of the apostate will stand up. 

Once the crimson of Boranel has spilled, the herald will lay claims to the throne of Cronepsis for their master.

He turns to Petr, thinking he might be the herald, urging him to not use his druidic magic so much. When asked why he warns Petr against this, Zenobaal explains that druidic magic is what Vvaraak taught, and people might come after Petr. However, both Bonzo and Galen deduce that Zenobaal still seems somewhat confused having just ‘awoken’ after twenty years of being under someone’s control and his views of this are perhaps not entirely of the time. 

They thank Zenobaal for sharing this information with them and then make their way back to the airship, where they rest up a moment. Beck has his dinner with Jonah later that day and the crew decides to accompany him. Before they leave, they catch Bonzo up on some of the group’s history with Jonah and then they set out to upper north edge, which is where the Gold and White bar is located. 

It’s a gauntly decorated place, with both Sharn and Breland flags on display as well as what seems to be a pile of weapons that some of the Sharn Watch that frequent the bar have left by the door. As it’s mostly a Sharn Watch bar, the group is eyed somewhat warily as they enter, but no one bothers them. Beck finds a table on his own, a wildshaped spider Petr travelling with him as Galen, Rydia and Bonzo find a table not too far away. 

At exactly eight pm, Jonah walks into the bar, wearing flowing robes and a large golden amulet on his chest depicting the House Cannith symbol: a gorgon. He seems to be unaware of the rest at their own table, sitting down and greeting Beck before ordering some drinks and food. Jonah says he thought Beck was dead, Beck pointing out that he seemed to want him dead. Jonah admits that might have been true to an extent - he was trying to protect the house and prevent any leaks of information. He asks if Beck did leak anything, which Beck confirms he didn’t. “I, unlike you, value our twenty years of friendship.” Jonah explains he had no idea that Beck and the crew were even on the job, Rosevyr was just a means to an end. However he does believe Beck didn’t tell anyone as the information doesn’t seem to be public - it’s not in any newspapers anyway.

Jonah confesses he’s in way over his head - he had hired a House Deneith assassin to deal with Fianin, as she had more information on the affairs of House Cannith than the rest. The rest of the crew simply got caught in the middle of that mission, which he apologises for. Fianin knew what was going on in Metrol, and hasn’t been much of a fan of the House since the Mourning - at least, that’s what Jonah assumes given they stole a collection of warforged from House Cannith. 

His job is to prevent House Cannith from getting into trouble - whether this be by keeping certain information secret or other means. Jonah is in favour of keeping secrets, as he knows if the information leaks, war would break out again. Whilst House Cannith could profit on the warforged again, Jonah believes no one would work with the House again. He is in favour of peace, but his father would take any excuse to restart the war between nations. At the moment, most of House Cannith agree with Jonah, but there are those that believe war would work in their favour. 

At present, Jonah is trying to secure what was used in Cyre. The warforged he sent after it haven’t returned, likely having joined the Lord of Blades. Beck asks what Jonah found in Metrol, Jonah eventually admitting that Yonhanna d’Cannith wrote a lot of letters she shouldn’t have. Jonah managed to find more letters, along with a set of plans to the object she was working on in Making, which she sent to her lover. 

Beck asks if the House is still after them, which Jonah confirms there’s no one he knows of. He’s had a rough couple of months, but it would seem Beck’s put most of it together himself. Jonah explains he was just trying to remove a problem, but Beck doesn’t seem to be one. Beck points out they could have just talked about it, but Jonah agrees he didn’t think to do that. Instead he asks for help, explaining he needs a crystal retrieved from Making. He’s also heard there’s more of these in the world, and they seem to be connected to other planes. He’s aiming to destroy them, but he doesn’t know how to do that. 

Telling Jonah they’re heading on a mission to Making anyway, he says they’ll keep an eye out for it. Jonah asks how that’s possible as no one has survived before, which Beck explains isn’t really his area of expertise. The mission is with a lot of people who seem to know what they’re doing, so he’s trusting them on that one. Jonah says he’s working with a company to try and obtain the others, but doesn’t know how that will go yet - he still has to meet with them. He knows there are other crystals, and his personal cleric believes the Dwarves may have one of them buried away somewhere. Beck asks how they would know this, Jonah saying she has an interest in the arcane. 

Asking about the company, Jonah names it as Altaner Artefacts, admitting he also has a contract with House Thurani, although they don’t know the full extent or details of what it is he’s looking for or why. All they really know is that Jonah needs help. After some reluctance, he also admits the contract was via Beck’s parents, as that’s the contact he has with the House. Jonah suggests they should all have a talk together if things to go plan with Altaner Artefacts, agreeing to arrange something before the group are due to depart for Making. 

Jonah gets up to leave, telling Beck he’s truly sorry about what happened, but the House comes first for him. Beck points out he owes him a favour at this point, asking if Jonah could do something about repairing D4, who was broken during Jonah’s assassination attempt. He agrees that he’ll see what he can do about that, before leaving just as his food arrives at the table.

Dropping out of wildshape, Petr and Beck make the most of Jonah’s order before regrouping with the others, who are once again discussing the porridge machine, and the potential for it to create pudding or something potentially more healthy. Bonzo asks Rydia for some recipes they could use in the machine, which she agrees to work on with him, and chastises the rest of the group for their scepticism. Galen assures her she can do whatever she wants, Rydia explaining all she really wanted to do was something easy to help people. Galen tells her his family aren’t exactly experts at helping the less fortunate, Rydia suggesting he could set an example for them. Galen says that’s unlikely to work, but Rydia then says that whilst they haven’t discussed this, if he wants to have his own legacy one day he might as well start setting the example now. 

Rydia asks Beck how the conversation with Jonah went, who relays what they discussed. Galen asks about the cleric, trying to recall the House Cannith connections in Karrnath. Whilst the Dragonmarked Houses have a number of enclaves across the nations, Galen is aware enough that Jonah and his father were follows of the Blood of Vol. This is the same religion the Sanguine Council have been puppeteering but on its own isn’t that suspicious. That said, the alliances between Jonah, Lady Dahlia and the religion could mean something, although Beck knows that Jonah wasn’t particularly close with his father, having left Karnnath in order to train for a more senior role in the House.
