# Wheel of Fortune Reversed

One of the gnomes on griffins reaches for one of the many wands all of them seem to carry in holsters, speaking into it, which makes his voice echo along the deck. “Welcome to Korranberg. Your vessel is unknown to us, you are to follow us to docking bay 5 and prepare for inspection of your goods.”

[[Korranberg]] the city is built mostly on an island in the middle of a river and as they fly over, they see that the western bank of the river is where most of the city is. [[The Heritage]] flies over massive waterfalls that emerge from the river; there are large water turbines that capture the power of the river.

Everything in the city is illuminated, in stark contrast to Gatherhold. Most of the space on the island is taken up by a massive building; a soaring tower with eight domes around it. Both Bonzo and Galen know that this is the library. On the western shore of the river is the rest of Korranberg; Bonzo and Galen also know that most of the people live on the shore, and work on the island. There's a plethora of flying mounts and carpets that people are using to ferry around town.

As Petr navigates the ship down towards Sky Port, Lux quickly consults with the captain, who suggests perhaps it would be wise to hide their rather large stash of Dreamlily. Lux does so before they land. They're being steered to what looks like the third floor of this tower they're approaching. Each floor has three massive hangar bays, one of which they're being ushered into. There's massive walkways made of metal on the sides of the hangars to allow people to traverse the place.

Killing the engine at the right time, Petr moves it where the gnomes want it to be. As they look around, they all realise that their ship really is tiny compared to most of the other airships docked here.

Two metal walkways extend from the sides of the ship, two gnomes on either side spinning a wheel to do so. The crew waits, until eventually a gnome approaches across one of the walkways, flanked by two large humans in half plate. The gnome is tiny, and is wearing a fedora as well as a large black coat, pulling out a small pipe as he inspect the ship, eventually walking up the gangplank.

“Good day,” the gnome says after boarding the ship. “Who's in charge here, who am I to speak to?” Lux steps forward, welcoming the gnome aboard the ship, offering the ship's name when asked. “You are very welcome aboard the Heritage.” She lies about where they came from, telling him they came from Vedykar instead of Gatherhold.

When asked if they're transporting any goods, Lux simply tells the gnome they're not transporting anything, instead offering that they're transporting both themselves and their passengers. The two humans then join on deck, both of them sporting the Mark of the Sentinel, a prominent dragonmark.

As the group are still taking in their surroundings, they notice a strange clockwork apparatus in the center of this docking area with a number of mirrors, that is seemingly constantly spinning.

The dockmaster then introduces himself as Nelson, telling them they can contact either him or the authorities if they need anything during their stay here. He then asks if it's okay if his two wards take a look around the ship, to which Lux tells him that's not a problem, saying they're free to look around. The two humans start looking around the deck before eventually looking around down below as well.

“What is your reason for visit?” Nelson then asks, to which Lux explains that two of their crew are familiar with Korranberg, and they wanted to visit. Nelson spots Bonzo, with his now fixed companion Betsy beside him. “Good day, Zil-gnome coming home?” he asks Bonzo, who confirms this. “I used to live here,” Bonzo confirms, before promising Nelson that he'll inform the rest of the crew of how things work here in Zilargo.

Nelson tells him and the others that the Trust is always around if they see anything worth reporting on. He also tells them that the Council of Nine might be interested in hiring people such as themselves, if they were to be in the market for some work. Bonzo then asks Nelson where they might buy parts to repair the ship, to which Nelson points out that either House Cannith (who will have raw materials), the library (specifically the college of natural that deals in raw materials) or the Sprite Market on Riverside would be good places to look.

The gnome lingers on deck as he waits for the humans to return, running his finger through some dust on the ship, starting to Prestidigitate things away as his wards come back from below. “Everything looks clean,” they inform him, and Nelson starts taking his leave, Lux stopping him to ask if they owe him a docking fee. “When you exit, there will be a booth. The price for docking is 20 gold per day, you will be asked to pay there,” he explains, Lux then thanking him for the information.

With Nelson gone, the group decide what to do next. Considering it's night time, the captain and Petr decide to stay on the ship and the others decide to, with the captain's permission, treat themselves to a nice place to stay that night. Bonzo and Galen know about a few places to stay. There's the Golden Dragon Inn on Riverside, there's the Fearless Tankard which is more of a tavern and fest hall, there's an inn on the island more for high level diplomats which is called the Third King Inn and then there's the Royal Bear, run by an ex-Brelish soldier, which is on the shore. There's also Shindig Lane, which is a street filled with fest halls.

As they're discussing where they could possibly stay, Bonzo suggests that they could go visit his mother's bakery, a suggestion the others are happy to take him up on. Rydia wonders if Bonzo's mom sells supplies as well as Galen has a bit of a crisis over whether or not he should've introduced Rydia to his parents by now.

Moving through the tower. On top of this ceiling is a gnome, wearing spectacles with various lenses that he's switching through. He's peering down in what seems to be a mirror system of sorts; it seems to be the the observation system that's in place in this tower.

This prompts Bonzo to tell the others they should be aware that they're always being watched in this town. “Anything that would be deemed kind of criminal or suspicious or would attract attention is not a good idea … there's the Trust here, it's a secret police force that keeps an eye on everything to keep everybody in check and they have lots of people in Korranberg working for them.”

As they exit the building, they pass by the toll booth that Nelson mentioned, seemingly manned by a bunch of soldiers, all of them human, hired mercenaries. Lux pays the initial 20 gold docking fee and the four of them then step out onto Aureons Plaza. Aureons Plaza includes the library, whole of the island as well as the building of the Council of Nine, and the building of the Korranberg Chronicle, the local newspaper.

Even at this hour there's still quite a lot of activity in the town, all sorts of people walking the streets still, most of them carrying books. They spot a lot of gnomes walking up to a stone, putting their hands on it before walking off, Galen and Bonzo knowing these are cleansing stones; instant Prestidigitation, and these things are everywhere in Zil society. Everything around them is very clean and properly maintained; it's urban paradise.

Bonzo starts leading the way through town towards his mother's bakery, pointing everyone in the direction of the cable carts.The cable cart takes them across the river and into the neighborhood of Riverside. Walking across the massive Sprite Market eventually leads them to a quieter corner of the ward where there's a simple house. There's a main entrance, which is gnome-sized with stairs going up to it and right next to it, is a larger door.

Not having expected to be back so soon, Bonzo's not sure what to make of finding himself in front of his ancestral home so soon after having left. He walks in though, leading the others inside as well. The bakery and home is decorated with simple rustic decorations, the bakery part largely empty as it's late in the evening and the goods will have been sold during the day. A voice from upstairs yells out that they're closed as a woman comes walking down.

They see a small, grey gnome woman with a nice purple vest, huge jam-like spectacles and relatively long nails, painted with what seems like little animated pictures. She also smells fantastic, moreso than just of baked goods, she also wears a very nice perfume. She stops dead in her tracks as she recognises her son. “Back so soon? Did it work out, have you sold a lot? Why are you in town?” she asks, to which Bonzo explains he had somewhat of an unlucky streak and promises to tell her all about it sometime.

“I'm back in Korranberg now with a couple of people and … we were hungry. We were wondering if you still had anything here, so I thought we would surprise you with a visit,” he goes on. His mother says there's pies in the oven if they want to wait for a moment, which they all happily agree to. She then introduces herself as Sharan, the group introducing themselves in turn as Galen, Lux and Rydia Bennet.

They're invited upstairs into a massive kitchen which seems to take up most of the house. There's a large central table; everything is made of wood with fine detailing and the smells in here are nice, but somewhat intense. The entire house smells of freshly baked pies with vegetables, garlic and various herbs.

She invites them all to have a seat and pours everyone a glass of water, which the group are grateful for. Bonzo turns to the group, extending his mother's offer of them staying the night to them, to which Rydia says they'd probably not stay the night, but she's very interested in trying these pies.

Bonzo's siblings come up, his mother explaining that his sister Snippy is out today, but his brother Bornic should be home within half an hour, as he's gathering supplies at the market. Galen turns to Rydia, promising her he'll take her to meet his parents next time they're in Sharn, saying he feels bad now. “Are you supposed to take someone to meet your parents are a week, or ..” They talk about Galen's parents for a moment, Galen pointing out they didn't approve of his life choices, Rydia eventually concluding it might be better if they don't go see Galen's parents.

“My sister? We can start with my sister,” Galen offers in turn, to which he adds it'll likely never happen as they'll never get to Sharn, but still.

Right around this time the pies are ready, three pies being pulled out of the oven. It's Bonzo's mother's ritual of sorts; she always bakes three pies, no matter how many or little guests she has in the house. She explains the pies, saying one is filled with vegetables, one is baked with cockatrice eggs and one is made with babble butter. The pies seem magically infused somehow. This prompts Rydia to ask where one might find supplies like these, she and Bonzo's mother talking about cooking and baking for a moment.

Whilst they're enjoying the cakes, Bonzo asks his mom about rumors and interesting jobs around town. She tells him she doesn't know much about jobs, but offering the Chronicle is looking for adventurers. “Other than that, usually the Council of Nine deals with jobs.” When it comes to rumors though, she knows plenty. She hears a lot over the counter of the bakery, and she shares a lot of social stuff about flings and such, before mentioning that they sent various people of the Trust over to the Canatar Manor recently, and none of them have returned. Bonzo suggests they can speak to the Council of Nine about this to see if they could be of any help.

She then apologises to Bonzo for his father not being here; he's chasing a story in Sharn. He's a journalist who works for the Korranberg Chronicle. Galen awkwardly comments on how often Bonzo has mentioned his father, saying it's a shame they won't get to meet him. Right around that time, Bonzo's brother Bornit comes in, carrying grocery bags full of supplies.

He calls out that he's home and it's only after a moment that the group realises he called out in gnomish, yet they were all able to understand what he said. It seems that this is one of the ways these pies are magically altered, the babble butter allowing them to understand and speak all languages, much like the Tongues spell. The cockatrice eggs, Bonzo's mother explains when asked, help harden your constitution somewhat.

Bonzo catches up with his brother, explaining why he's here. After unloading the groceries, Bornit offers the group some wine, an offer they gladly accept. The wine seems magically altered as well, the scent very complex. Meanwhile, Bonzo's mother has started gathering a spice rack of sorts for Rydia, handing them to her.

After finishing their food and wine, Bonzo suggests they could move on, Galen instead suggesting that, if Bonzo wants to stay with his family, he definitely should. They agree to meet up at the library the following morning, specifically at Ballinor's Horn. Bonzo stays with his family as Galen, Lux and Rydia head out to find themselves a place to stay, Galen leading the way towards the Golden Dragon Inn.

It's an impressive building, six stories high, standing alone on the promenade. Every room has a balcony and there's massive vertical gardens that climb all the way up to the top, containing weird large purple flowers. Everything looks pristine, as it does everywhere else, and they're welcomed heartily by a couple of halflings.

Galen does the talking, asking for a couple of rooms for them. It's five gold per room, dinner would be an additional three, and the halflings offer some rooms with view of the river. They're given room keys and they all retreat to their rooms for the night. Rydia, who doesn't need to sleep anymore, spends most of the night staring out from the balcony, taking in her surroundings.

The following morning, Bonzo is awoken early and somewhat crudely by his sister Snippy dunking a bucket of ice cold water onto his head. “Good to see you again,” Snippy offers, before telling Bonzo to get up and help out in the bakery, which he agrees to do. He helps out until it's time to leave for the library.

Lux woke up early as well, heading into town to try and look around for any kind of temples in town. She has a quiet walk around the city, taking in her surroundings as she does so. She notices something that looks like a temple on the other side of the island, but soon realises that this a temple to Aureon, the sovereign of knowledge and law, also known as the first wizard.

Asking around a bit, she finds there's not a lot of temples around town, but there is a shrine to Olladra in Shindig Lane. She follows the directions there, walking past a couple of gnomes that are cleaning everything in the street before she gets to a circle plaza with two trees on it. In the center there's a statue of a woman with a tambourine in her hand, dice thrown across the floor and she's wearing ornate large hooped arm rings. There's a bowl with gold coins, that have been put in there for good luck.

Approaching the statue, Lux digs through her pack to pull out a coin, tossing it in the bowl. She also pulls out her wife's tarot deck, pulling a random card. It's the reversed Wheel of Fortune, which means bad luck, as well as breaking cycles. After taking a moment, she starts walking around town for a bit longer, asking for directions to the library, eventually finding her way there to meet up with the others.

As she's moving through the city, she sees a couple of gnomes dressed in really fine gear. Some of them have illusory butterflies flying around them; she knows this is called glamourweave, or shiftweave. She makes a mental note that finding something like that would be useful for when taking on different personas.

Meeting up at Ballinor's Horn, they discuss what to do that day. Rydia says she wants to head into town to look for supplies, asking if anyone needs her to look for something. Lux asks her if she can look for glamourweave, just asking her to look for it instead of buy it, as Lux will have to have a moral debate with herself as to whether or not she thinks she can afford this.

Bonzo and Lux agree to head into the college to get supplies for the ship, Galen pointing out he'd like to spend some time in the library. Rydia suggests that, instead of meeting back up at the ship, they should meet up at the library, as last time she left Galen in a library she found him in a corner somewhere, asleep on a book. They all agree to this and then go their separate ways.

Galen heads to the library, very familiar with how the system there works. The inside of the library is filled with sunlight, parts of the walls seeming to let through the light as if there's no wall there at all. The illusion magic here gives off a nice, quiet air to the place. There's doors down below that aren't accessible, as there are no door knobs. The only thing on this floor is a large desk with three gnomes behind it.

Everybody checking in gets a wooden saucer with a single drop of mercury in it, which allows you to control your Tenser's Floating Disc, which allows you to float to the right place so you can gather your books and do your research. Galen knows the discs are active for one hour, and that you can renew them at the desk with the gnomes.

Galen gathers his wooden saucer with mercury and floats up, starting his search for books on some of the things he wants some more information on. He first looks into Q'barra as well as the temple and the phrase Rydia was saying whilst she was in her coma.

He finds the section on Q'barra and, on the other side of the aisle, is the section on Dragons of Argenessen and he quickly figures out he needs both. He then finds a place to read through these books, sitting down and digging in.

The first book he finds is The First Account of King Sebastis Ir'Kesslan of New Gallifar. It is mostly a discussion on how wild Q'barra is and what type of species used to live there before civilization arrived. It says “The scales in the region are mostly hostile, especially to those harvesting or mining dragonshards, of which there are a lot on the subcontinent. Talks with the native scales have led to either hostility or strange gospitlization of something they call In'Quor, roughly translated to ‘The Dream'.”

He calls New Gallifar the triangle of civilization, [[Newthrone]], Adderport and Whitecliff all centered around the Adder River. Then there's a pearl necklace of prospecting towns on the foot of the Endworld Mountains, prominent small towns include Wyrmwatch, Threshold and Hope. These towns mainly fend for themselves, but King Sebastes has provided various medical supplies and aid stations.

Information on the temple is harder to find, but with the help of one of the Avowed Galen finds a book with some leaked scraps of the draconic prophecy. In this book he finds the rhyme that contains the sentence that Rydia was saying.

> Recount the failures of he who walked in dreams (Note: [[Arag]])
> His large crystal coming apart at the seams
> The first eye lands where Eberron is breaking
> Twisted into something not worth Making
> The giants second eye, a tempest swallowed whole
> An isle full of thieves still pays its yearly toll
> Eyes of third lie in precious treasure
> Darkness surrounding preventing any measure
> The fourth eye is blinded by the trees
> Corroded scales now looking over its keys
> And fifth, where frozen wastes will arise in
> The mist folds into the unknown horizon

Looking into the draconic prophecy and Q'barra, he finds information on other dragonborn who came to Q'barra. They were escorting a powerful back dragon named Rhashaak. They defeated and bound a demonic overlord named [[Masvirik]], also known as the Cold Sun underneath Q'barra and guard it to this day. The dragonborn that settled in Q'barra actually briefly colonized it.

There's still runes of their occupation throughout the jungle. Dragonborn a bit more talkative, but also seem like the people who are the most adamant and violent when it comes to harvesting dragonshards. The city that the dragonborn created deep in the jungle is called Haka'torvhak. None of King Sebastis' scouts have been able to find it, but he did also mention this city in his account.

This book specifically names this as the location of the Temple of Luminescent Blight, a temple that was built to remember Rhashaak and his epic struggle.

After looking into this, Galen looks for books on manifest zones. He finds that a fair amount is known about manifest zones and that the following are known to people:

* Daanvi, the Perfect Order

* Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams (Manifest zones were banned by the giants of Cul'Sir)

* Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead

* Fernia, the Sea of Fire (fist of onatar, Korranberg )

* Irian, the Eternal Day

* Kythri, the Churning Chaos (blackcap mountains)

* Lamannia, the Twilight Forest

* Mabar, the Endless Night (Fort Bones The Gloaming - Eldeen Reaches)

* Risia, the Plain of Ice (Graywall Mountain peaks)

* Shavarath, the Battleground

* Syrania, the Azure Sky (Sharn)

* Thelanis, the Faerie Court

* Xoriat, the Realm of Madness (closed off)

He already knew about the manifest zone in Sharn, as it's where he's from. The manifest zone there actually helps Sharn stay aloft, helps the towers of Sharn be so massive.

With some time left, Galen looks into Aerenal as well as Senechal. He finds that the Aerenal are an ancient civilization of elves, living on a continent of the same name. They keep traditions alive; one of the first elves is still alive there. They call it the Undying Court, they framed necromancy in a positive way to keep their heroes and statesmen alive as long as possible. The elves of Aerenal are all about tradition and can spent 150 years perfecting the pronunciation of Prestidigitation just to get it right. They feel humans are dangerous, rash and unpredictable.

Galen also finds that Seneschal are the eldest in the service staff of a woman known as Erandis Vol. He also knows that she is a figure of myth, supposedly half elf and half dragon. Bearer of the last Mark of Death.

Meanwhile, Bonzobur and Lux have headed into Ballinor's Horn. It looks like a keep of sorts, it has water elements coming down on each side. It's mainly filled with classrooms, but around it there are also various workshops to accommodate students and inside there's another big workshop, usually for classes but they do also have supplies there.

There's a number of students there as they head inside, as well as a teacher that Bonzo actually recognises. He knows this to be Lassius Dorian Korran; he's part of one of the founding families of Korranberg. He's wearing a nice red robe and has a big, bushy white beard that he has decorated with all sorts of gems. It takes him a moment, but then he recognises Bonzo as well.

Bonzo introduces Lux to him as well, before asking about materials and supplies for the airship. Bonzo tells him what they'd need to get the ship fixed, opting for regular wood instead of soar wood, as well as some clay tiles to fix the roofing on the captain's cabin.

Knowing that an elemental would speed up the ship significantly, Bonzo asks about what something like that would cost. Lassius tells him that they'd need an elemental ring, which would cost them about 500 gold. Then the elementals themselves would cost them quite some money as well; a bound fire elemental would cost them 4000 gold, and a bound air elemental 2750 gold.

He suggests this to Lux, who recognises that this would be helpful, but also points out they'd have to run this by the captain, and she's pretty sure they don't have that kind of money right now.

They opt for basic repairs for the ship, at least for now, for which the materials cost them about 240 gold. Bonzo knows that about half of that gold will go into the library themselves, to help buy up material for students, so it'll go to a good cause.They're asked for measurements, so they head back towards the ship to get those. As soon as they have the measurements they can get things made and what they need for the ship will be ready tomorrow. They also arrange the transport of the sized materials towards Sky Port.

Before they head out, Bonzo asks Lassius if there's any news. He says elemental binding has been good and profitable, also points out they have a very good class this year. “Other than that, nothing strange has happened in the library, … although. I've heard some of my students say they saw a dead man wandering across Shindig Lane the other day,” Lassius offers, saying the Council and the Trust have already put a bounty out on the man.

Bonzo says they were planning on dropping by the Council anyway, so they could potentially look into that, before he and Lux head back towards the ship to get the measurements. They find the Captain and Petr gearing up to leave, having packed their stuff already. The captain shares that they've procured tickets and they'll be leaving in about two hours. Petr will be away for about six days and the captain plans on spending some time in [[Passage]].

She asks Lux if she doesn't mind watching over the ship for a while, which she tells her isn't a problem. Lux tells her to be careful, and she assures her she'll be safe in [[Passage]] and she trusts the man she'll be staying with, with her life. They share a hug, saying their good-byes for now before Lux and Bonzo take the measurements and start heading back towards the library.

As they're walking out of Sky Port, Lux notices that someone's following them. It looks to be a male half-elf, which stands out, considering that the organization known to be keeping an eye on things consists out of gnomes. Lux points this out to Bonzo and the two of them quickly discuss what to do, before Lux suggests they just approach this man and ask him what he wants.

They do so, which seems to surprise the half-elf. As they get closer, they see the half-elven man a little better. He has a weather-worn face, covered in tattoos and wears a blue leather jacket and a sable on his side. He has long-ish blond hair. “I mean no harm,” the half-elf says, “Just wanted to see if you fancied a drink.” Lux confirms he wants a drink with both of them, as the half-elf checks if they are indeed the owners of the airship.

“Name is Ivello Neretti,” he then offers, though Lux, who spots the dragonmark on his neck, quickly deduces that might not be his real name. This half-elf belongs to house Lyrander, as he carries the Mark of the Storm, though it's somewhat hidden underneath his abundance of tattoos.

Lux and Bonzo still agree to go for a drink with him and follow Ivello into a tavern, right across from the College of Philosophy, so the tavern is filled with drunk students who can't handle life. They join him at a table, realising this tavern is slightly less pristine than the rest of this city, soon deducing this tavern is run by a dwarf.

Ivello orders them some drinks, then sits down at the table again. “So, why I wanted to have a drink in this, somewhat rowdy place,” he then starts, leaning in across the table. “I saw you leave your ship yesterday, you seem like a rowdy bunch, saw some blood stains if I'm not mistaken…” He goes on to say he respects sailors of any sort, looking around before he continues. “Would you be interested in a free bound elemental?”

In turn, he wants them to help him sneak into the college so he can learn how the process of binding an elemental works. Bonzo and Lux suggests he could maybe just ask, but apparently Zilargo doesn't allow people of his house to know those things, as it's the only leverage they have on House Lyrandar.

They don't tell him yes, but also don't tell him no, instead telling Ivello they'll need to discuss this with the others. Before they leave, Lux asks where they can reach him. “I can usually be found at the Third King Inn. Just ask for Ivello, they'll send you to my room,” he tells them, before pointing out where the inn is.

Excusing themselves, Bonzo and Lux head back towards the college to deliver the measures.

Rydia has meanwhile been shopping around town, looking for a number of things. She tries to find some cockatrice eggs, but when she realises they're 80 gold a piece she decides against getting some, instead going for regular eggs. She also gets more cake supplies, finding them easily.

Whilst searching for these magic eggs, Rydia also finds out that there's a magic shop in Korranberg named Viqora's Secret Stash, which might be interesting to check out at some point.

She then makes her way back to Sky Port in time to make Petr a cake, handing it to him before he leaves, telling him it's for his mother. The cake literally says ‘for Petr's mom'.

After making the cake and saying good-bye to Petr and the captain, Rydia heads back in town to buy some more things. She heads to a shop called Blackpowder and speaks to the owner, eventually buying 10 silver bullets that she intends on giving to Galen, after doing a somewhat terrible job explaining how Galen's regular bullets don't do damage to some types of creatures.

With everyone's shopping and researching done for the day, they all meet up back at the library.
