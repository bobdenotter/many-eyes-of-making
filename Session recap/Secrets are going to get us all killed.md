# Secrets are going to get us all killed
As soon as Rydia noticed her jaw closing, she moved back out of the tent. Though the mental strain of keeping the jaw hidden was gone, the crystal cancelling out her magic makes her feel like she’s not her new natural self anymore. Though she felt some of her magic leave her, she could notably still hear people’s thoughts, suggesting to her that those powers come from somewhere else. 

Outside the tent, she spots five warforged coming in through the gate, looking decidedly worse for wear. She overhears them talking to some of the warforged inside the camp, listening to them talk of how they came across a hulking behemoth of a creature, who killed most of their party.

As they move further into the camp, Rydia notices them trying to get a look into the tent, as if they’re looking for something, or someone. 

Back inside, the Lord of Blades continues his conversation with the group. They mention Yonhanna, which seems to surprise him, as he thinks someone called Kalaraq is in charge, and not Yonhanna. This is a name that doesn’t mean anything to anyone in the group.

He elaborates, saying that they were able to look at the final thoughts of some of the warforged who were found dead, and all their thoughts were centered around this name: Kalaraq.

The fact that the group doesn’t know anything about this name or this entity makes the Lord of Blades question whether or not they know what is actually going on inside Making. Beck tells him that they do know what they’re looking for, even if the Lord once again points out they don’t know what they’re up against. 

Regardless, he thinks they can help each other, and he calls out for Safeguard, a spindly looking warforged who seems to be a captain of sorts. He asks Safeguard to gather a group so he can scout out the secret entrance and then decide on a plan, which prompts Galen to point out they are operating under a bit of a time constraint here. 

The Lord of Blades still insists they should know what they’re walking into. Petr suggests that he can accompany Safeguard and his group to look for the entrance, which is an offer the Lord takes him up on.

He then calls out for another warforged, Grip. He is the captain of the guard, and he’s wearing a large holy symbol. He tells Grip to spread the word amongst the camp that these humans aren’t to be harmed. 

Beck then tells the Lord about Hilt and Scimitar and how they were under someone’s control. He also shares that they seemed to be less influenced by said control the further away they got from Making and Clawrift.  The Lord of Blades asks him where Hilt and Scimitar are right now and when Beck says they’re on their way back, the Lord sends out some of his people to go collect them. 

He mutters some spells into crystals, given them to some of his warforged, who incorporate the crystals into their bodies before flying off. 

With the Lord of Blades out of the tent to give out these orders, Bonzo, Beck and Galen take their chance to quickly look around the tent they’re in. They take a look at the crystal, which obviously has some sort of anti magic properties. Galen thinks it’s a kyber dragonshard, with a draconic origin. There are intricate grooves carved into it and it looks well made. 

Outside, Rydia is keeping an eye on these five new warforged, noting how they seem to be interested in Petr, all five of them sharing a look after they see him cross the camp and enter a tent. She telepathically alerts Galen of this and goes to investigate.

Galen, as well as Bonzo and Beck are asked to leave the tent by the Lord of the Blades when he returns, and as they walk back out into the camp, they take note of the three wells of water spread across said camp. They also notice what seems to be a failed well, a tarp across a hole. 

Rydia addresses the five warforged, who have gathered by one of the roaring fires in the camp. She asks them about the prisoners in the pen, who they also seemed to show an interest in. “They are foolish mortals who came wandering over from Making,” one of the warforged says, Rydia pointing out that describes her and her friends as well.

The warforged suggests it wouldn’t be hard to make sure that they end up in the prison pen as well, to which Rydia points out that she is a guest of the Lord of Blades, and so are her friends.

When Galen joins Rydia, she tells him she was simply playing the part of concerned citizen, the two of them briefly reminiscing about how they used to do that more often. 

Before the conversation with these warforged can get out of hand, two of the group are called away by Grip, put on guard duty in one of the towers. The three others urge Rydia not to misbehave before they walk away as well, Rydia mirroring the sentiment to them.

With the warforged gone, Rydia tells Galen she doesn’t trust them. Galen asks her if she’s alright, noting how she left the tent, but Rydia tells him she’s alright. She does show some concern for Petr, who she quickly checks in with telepathically. He tells her he’s alright, he’s just going over the plan with Safeguard.

Meanwhile, Beck and Bonzo make their way over to the prison pen, hoping to talk to the Inspired that are there. Bonzo starts a conversation, but is quickly called out by one of the guards. He suggests they get Rydia instead, who can speak to these prisoners from a distance, so Bonzo goes to get here as Beck remains by the prisoners. 

There’s a brief discussion about what to ask these people, before everyone but Petr moves towards the prison pen and Rydia speaks to the Inspired. They tell her that they were trying to infiltrate the camp. When asked why, they speak of how the camp was built upon a cairn belonging to a long dead dragon. They mention the crystal inside the tent, referring to it as the Heart of Xarkon. 

As this conversation continues, Galen spots something moving through the air, almost invisible to the eye. It slips into the tent that Petr is in. Galen points this out to Beck, but before either of them get to do much, Petr is walking out of the tent and towards the group of warforged. 

He hands one of them his staff, and the warforged starts floating. Petr seems unperturned by this, which strikes Beck, who knows how important the staff is, as odd. He warns the others, telling them the staff is important, that it’s a gatekey, and then he starts moving towards where Petr is. 

Trying to make sense of the situation, Beck deduces that the warforged know exactly what they’re doing, and seem pleased to have the staff in their possession. He also realises that they might not seem who they are, and that Petr was manipulated into this by what seems to be a near invisible creature, attached to the back of his head.

The others move in as well, Galen quickly deducing the same thing Beck did and he calls out that these aren’t warforged before casting Slow on the whole group. The leader of this group of not-warforged attempts to cast a spell, but Novac is quick to dispel it and now that spells are being slung, combat is soon underway. 

The situation is tense, as though these are not warforged, they still look like warforged, which leads to confusion on the side of the actual warforged, including the Lord of Blades. During the fight, he walks out, calling out for everyone to lower their arms, but he’s not listened to. Instead, he’s targeted by a dominate spell, which Lina is quick to dispel.

The leader of the not-warforged is quick to regret his spell, as the Lord of the Blades now joins the fight, quickly dispatching of this leader. As he falls to the ground, the warforged disguise drops, revealing him to be a mindflayer. 

Rydia finishes off the last two of these mindflayers, blasting one in the chest and throwing the other off the guard tower, putting an end to the fight. 

With the combat concluded, the Lord of Blades is quick to check in with his people, asking if everyone’s alright. His people assure him they’re fine, though Grip points out this likely means that the actual warforged they sent out on patrol were killed by these mindflayers. 

Galen takes this moment to ask Petr about his staff being a gateway key, Petr explaining it’s one of the keys that is meant to be kept safe, as it keeps the Daelkyr locked up. He goes on to say that the society he’s a part of is very secretive, but they worship Vvaraak, which he thinks is a good thing. They helped Vvaraak defeat the Daelkyr the first time and they now have the keys to keep them locked away.

Bonzo asks why there’s keys in the first place, and if they shouldn’t just destroy the keys to make sure no one escapes, but Petr is reluctant to make that choice in the moment. 

During this discussion, the group takes note of that failed well, with the tarp over it. During the combat, some of the tarp moves and they note a soft blue glow coming from inside what seems to be a cave. Bonzo peers inside, realising the glow comes from a continual flame spell, and noticing some draconic script on the walls as well. 

Safeguard tells the group there’s nothing down there but bones and raw material, but the want to take a look anyway. Beck suggests he thinks he can cast some light, bringing up his hand, and as he casts the spell he can feel a slight breeze in his neck, as time slows down around him. He hears a voice on the wind, saying ‘darling’ and for a moment, he finds himself in Metrol, warm sunlight reflecting of the waters of Starlight Bay. 

He sees his wife and his daughter, but as he tries to take a step towards them, the illusion fades and he’s back in the camp. 

Trying his best to shake off what just happened, he joins the others down in the cave, where they find a massive draconic skull as well as a large pile of gold and silver. 

Rydia, Galen and Beck, who all read draconic, take a look at the scribblings on the wall. The texts speak of this being a resting place of Xarkon, the Son of Kyber. They continue on about mortals and magic, and how this dragon believed the mortals were squandering the gifts they were given.

There’s a specific section on the wall that states Xarkon’s interest in Vvaraak’s prophecies, specifically in the Coming. He seemed almost in favor of the demise of mortals, as he viewed them as problematic. 

“And then she of the many eyes pollutes the minds of those closely working near my grave,” one of the lines on the wall says. 

Unable to read the text, Bonzo casts Detect Magic to search for other things in the room, finding that some of the coins in the pile of gold and silver are lighting up with illusionary magic. 

Galen and Bonzo then take a look at the dragon skull, deducing it belonged to a blue dragon. There are etchings in the back of the skull that are fairly old, seemingly resembling three eyes. Galen recognises this symbol as the one of Sora Theraza, who is the seer of the Daughters of Sora Kell. 

He knows that Sora Theraza is always looking for willing people to be her eyes in the world and deduces that Xarkon might’ve been such a willing spy. He does also note that Xarkon is essentially a dragon of legend; he’s been dead a long time. Beck also knows that Xarkon is somewhat of a cautionary tale amongst Cyrians; he was known to bring misery and pain to Cyre. Callousness with magic would prompt seniors to say to “beware of the Son of Kyber, for he does not like it when you are reckless with magic”

With the cave inspected, Galen turns to Beck, asking him about the gatekey, making it clear he feels pretty strongly about how they shouldn’t be keeping secrets. Beck says that this was all Petr’s thing to share, but he does tell the others that Petr works with the Gatekeepers, sharing the Gatekeepers’ goals of keeping the gates to other planes, specifically Xoriat and Kyber, shut. 

The name Gatekeepers rings a bell for Galen, and he’s fairly certain that the people who were looking into him and Rydia way back when, were part of that organisation as well. Galen then asks Beck if he trusts Petr with their lives. “I already did, and I still do,” Beck responds, to which Galen points out he doesn’t like being lied to, especially when it concerns Rydia and what happened to them. 

He and Rydia then leave the cave. Outside, they notice Novac is speaking to the Inspired prisoners, whilst Lina is taking the time to look over the mindflayer corpses.

Bonzo heads out of the cave as well, checking up on some of the warforged that got hurt during the fight. He strikes up a conversation with them, and is given a marble that is referred to as a tingle rock.

He tells them that the reason he came to them and healed them, is that he’s hoping to prove that they are not enemies, and can in fact be allies. Safeguard comments on his holy symbol, asking him why he follows a creature he cannot see or touch. Bonzo explains that creation itself has been given to them, and he thinks Onathar gives him that power of creation.

“Everything that should be created, should aid creation, not destruction,” he says, admitting he strayed from that path once upon a time, but is finding his way back now. Safeguard says that they do aid creation, and are in fact creating a god, one that they can touch. 

Curious, Bonzo asks if they can visit this becoming god, but he’s told they’re only allowed to do so with the permission from the Lord. 

As if on cue, said Lord of Blades then calls out for everyone and they gather back in his command tent. He shares that his people found Hilt and Scimitar and that they manage to break the control spell on them. They are now resting, but have agreed to share whatever information they have with the Lord, as well as with the group, the following morning. 

His plan is to gather said information from Hilt and Scimitar the following morning, and then head out to Clawrift about an hour after that. The crew is offered a place to stay that night and Beck suggests they take him up on the offer, as they might also gain valuable information from Hilt and Scimitar that following morning. 

After this, they’re shown to a tent that has been prepared for them, and Beck and Petr split off from the group. Petr points at the now dead blob that was attached to the back of his head, which seems to be some sort of parasitic aberration. They deduce it was likely sent by the mindflayers.

They then talk about the key and Petr admits that he wants to talk to Thom about it. He also says he might want to take a bit of a break, as a lot is happening, and now apparently dangerous people are after him as well. He says that he can also take the time to head to the Eldeen Reaches, speak to the Gatekeepers and perhaps gather more information about Vvaraak. He also suggests that he could check up on the captain on his way there. 

Beck, though sad to see Petr go, agrees this sounds like a good plan and Petr says he’ll stay with them the following day, after which he intends to transport himself via plants to where Thom is. Before leaving Petr to it, Beck double checks if he’s okay with Beck sharing what Petr was asked to do with the rest of the group, to which Petr points out he thinks most of them already know. 

Beck then seeks out Galen, who’s been seething in a corner somewhere, accompanied by Rydia. He informs the two of them that Petr is intending on leaving, before sharing that Petr was indeed asked by the Gatekeepers to look into Rydia soon after they all met. He explains that they didn’t know each other very well yet, before adding that Petr told the group that Rydia wasn’t a threat. 

Galen tells him that he still trusts Beck, and he still trusts Petr, but he doesn’t want to get lied to again. They agree to no more secrets, as things are plenty dangerous around them as it is, and then, with Bonzo joining as well, they go over the plan for tomorrow. They agree to hear out Hilt and Scimitar in the morning and then decide whether or not they join the warforged through the secret entrance. 

With it getting late, they divide up watches, Bonzo pointing out that whilst some goodwill seems to have been established, they should still be careful. 

Galen takes the first watch with Rydia, during which very little happens. Bonzo takes the second and also doesn’t notice much, though Galen soon starts stirring in his sleep. 

He has an uneasy dream, finding himself in Altenar Artefacts. It’s dead quiet and near a large potted tree in the hall, he finds his father. “Where have you been?” Beren asks, seeming rather distressed as Galen notes they saw each other but a few days ago. 

Having taken note of Galen stirring in his sleep, Rydia attempts to cast Dream to see what’s going on, but for some reason her spell doesn’t seem to work right away. She isn’t sure why. Not taking any chances, she shakes Galen, hoping to wake him up. 

Back in the dream, Galen’s father bursts out in tears as he turns to his son. “Ophelia came into the room where I was working,..” he starts, his sentence interrupted as Galen is pulled from his dream, waking up.
