# Breaking Point

Hearing more footsteps approaching from the hallway behind them, Beck tells the lizardfolk to gather up the rest of the people here, the three who he’d previously convinced heading out of the room to do so. As they leave, more armoured lizardfolk arrive from another entrance, asking what they’re doing here. Beck says he’s here to tell them they’re making a mistake by doing what [[Masvirik]] wants and following [[Korlasz]], whilst instructing [[Sekkalok]] to go and find [[Akulele]]. 
 
After an uneasy standoff, the other lizardfolk return with seven more, leaving them with a group of nearly thirteen in the room. Confirming this is everyone in the barracks, Beck says it’s come to his attention that the lizardfolk are serving [[Masvirik]], the one that his ancestors locked away centuries ago. As Beck says this, the blood in the pool behind them begins to ripple, the lizardfolk confirming what he says. “So you’ve betrayed my ancestors?” Some of the lizardfolk begin to shift nervously, a few eyes darting towards the pool. Galen and Rydia shift slightly to get a better look at the pool, Galen realising there seems to be an odd shape forming in the liquid, almost looking like a serpent’s snout.

As Beck talks, a voice echoes in all of their minds in multiple voices and languages - “Who invokes the false words of my feeble brethren? Who dares to ally themselves with these so called martyrs?” The blood in the pool starts to roil and foam, Beck responding that he does, the voice asking who he is. As this happens, the form of a snake starts to rise from the pool, coiling out of the blood. Beck steps back as Rydia prepares an attack. The thing rising from the blood seems feathered, but seems to have a radiant glow emenating from it. 

Realising this seems to be some sort of couatl, Beck asks who’s asking, and why he should explain himself to them. The creature introduces himself as [[Marien]], the only one still living. Beck points out his kind helped back then, but Marien rejects this, saying they made the changelings. Beck asks what he wants - “I want to do what my brethren forbade me to do - I want free [[Masvirik]] and so will you.” He calls out in draconic, ordering the lizardfolk to baptise them. The lizardfolk seem hesitant, torn between agreeing with Beck and their fear of Marien.

Still connected to the pool of blood, Marien rises from it, leaning forward and spraying a jet of blood over Petr, Beck and Rydia. All three are thrown back towards the wall, Beck and Rydia falling unconscious from the force of the blow as Petr manages to resist the seeping corruption from the blood. Stepping forward, he uses a Thunderwave to knock Marien back towards the pool, stone shattering as the impact hits it. Jets of blood emerge from the pool, striking the lizardfolk whose eyes turn red, becoming enraged as a result.

Rushing over to Rydia’s side, Galen does his best to patch up her wounds as the battle continues, some of the lizardfolk fleeing from the room as they see an unconscious Beck on the ground. Bonzo fires as Marien from cover behind a pillar, the couatl responding by stretching out towards Bonzobur, wrapping around him to constrict him, the blood engulfing him as it does so, the corruption spreading once more. Petr heals Beck, although he doesn’t wake up from unconsciousness. Standing close to the wall, Galen notices as the frescos come alive, reaching out towards him and trying to grapple him to the wall. He rips free, pulling out the gun and firing a shot at [[Marien]], the bullet ripping through with a splash as the creature turns to look at Galen. 

Dreaming again, Beck is back at his old house, the windows all broken as the breeze blows through. He’s at the dining table, surrounded by a collection of Yasmin’s commemorative plates, with a crystal on the table in front of him, ever shifting and changing - the same thing Athelonia was holding. Beck reaches for it, the wood of the table turning grey and lifeless as he picks it up, but he can feel the power within the gem. His hand trembles from it, and just as he gains control of that, the door opens, Jonah d’Cannith walking inside.

“Do you actually know what you have there?” Jonah asks, Beck admitting he doesn’t, but it seems powerful. Jonah confirms this, Beck asking if that’s why he wants it. “I don’t want it. I want to get rid of it. I had it, and it led to one of the biggest fuck ups in the world.” Beck asks if this was the Mourning, which Jonah confirms, Beck stating this means it’s his fault. Jonah however disagrees, saying that he knew what they were doing and was tasked with cleaning up after the House, but it wasn’t his fault. Jonah claims those responsible were put to the knife. 

“Then how come someone’s talking about doing it again?” Jonah asks who, Beck telling him it’s an ancient queen. Jonah says it wouldn’t be easy - he asks Beck how he found the crystal, as he thought he destroyed it. Beck asks if he took it from Metrol, but Jonah says it came from a location underneath Making. He asks where Beck got the crystal from, Beck explaining he found it there, on his kitchen table, which Jonah seems to find hard to believe. He says it seems strange, at which point the door opens behind him, Yasmin and Naveena walking inside, Beck’s wife and daughter. Yasmin asks if everything’s alright as he seems tense.

Stepping forward, Nerima manages to rouse the remaining lizardfolk into fighting back, those still uncorrupted stepping forward to attack at Marien. Still engulfed by the couatl, Bonzo fires two shots into it, the grip releasing as Marien transforms into a cloud of red mist, the form of the creature reappearing on the other side of the room near Galen. Marien bites out at him, Galen dodging the worst of the blow, but unable to avoid the grip of the creature, which crushes him into unconsciousness. Petr immediately heals Galen, although he doesn’t wake up, before Petr launches in to attack Marien, trying to get it to release him. 

In another of Masvirik’s Nightmares, Galen finds himself falling, and as he wakes realises he’s on the deck of the Heritage, which is plummeting towards the ground. Bracing for impact, the ship crashes, splinters of wood flying out as a smoke hazes over his vision. As it clears, it seems they’ve crashed in the middle of a battleground, and in amongst the wreckage of the ship, he can see the severely wounded forms of Petr and Beck. Moving through the wreck towards them, the wounds severe enough that before Galen can do anything, Beck sucumbs to his wounds. As he breathes his last, a blue ethereal gas emerges from his mouth, shooting straight into Galen’s sternum. 

Looking around the ship, he can make out Rydia near the bow, who seems similarly wounded, half of her body turned into a soup of eyes and tentacles, pieces of wood stuck in her body. Moving to Petr, Galen tries his best to save Petr, who looks up at Galen and asks ‘Why?’ before falling back, a similar blue gas emerging from him and entering Galen. 

Rushing over towards Rydia, Galen finds her in dire straights, bleeding out although still conscious. She laughs slightly when she sees Galen, asking what happened. Galen tells her he was hoping she could tell him, asking her not to die on him. Rydia says she can’t remember anything, lamenting having left Fairhaven - it was boring, but at least it wasn’t this. “You always hated boring,” Galen points out, before doing his best to patch up her wounds, putting enough pressure on her wounds to stop the immediate bleeding. They share a long look before Galen feels a shadow fall across his back, looking over his shoulder to see [[Lady Ophelia Vidante]] standing behind him, flanked by spindly men in black robes. She has her hand raised, the low winter sun obscuring some of Galen’s vision as she twists her hand, that same ethereal gas entering Galen as the life leaves Rydia under his hands. 

More blood hits the lizardfolk, the battle spreading further as Nerima moves to protect the unconscious Beck. As they do, Akulele rushes into the room, approaching Beck and beginning to pull him away, chanting in Draconic, causing Beck to wake up a few moments later. Seizing the opportunity, he casts Dissonant Whispers at Marien, causing him to flee out of the room and under the door, the corrupted lizardfolk seeming to calm a little at this. Bonzo fights off one coming towards him as the couatl sprays another jet of blood from under the door it fled through, hitting Nerima and [[Sekkalok]], Nerima falling unconscious as Sekkalok seems to be corrupted by the blood. Seeing this, Petr immediately rushes forward, using a Lesser Restoration to cleanse the effects.

The wall reaches out to Bonzo, grappling him as the fight rages on, Sekkalok cutting through the hostile lizardfolk. As he does, Akulele tells Beck to get out of there, looking to him as she spots both Galen and Rydia unconscious on the ground. Beck tells her to wake Galen, as he can likely get through to Rydia. She completes the same chant, Galen waking up from his nightmare. Meanwhile, Beck responds “I’m not leaving my friends”, crawling towards Marien. Still in his white form, Beck’s dragonmark visibly glows and pulses as an arc of lightning shoots through the couatl, shattering the creature apart as the form of Marien scatters into a rain of blood.  

Meanwhile locked in a dream, Rydia finds herself in a wooded clearing, with a crumbling stone shrine nearby. There’s no clear markings, other than four fangs carved into the keystone, and a staircase descending into the ground. She recognises this as the place they found the Tome of Vvarraak, and sees herself standing at the top of the shrine, waiting for the others to come back. After a few moments, she can hear the rest of the [[Golden Grin]] laughing and coming back up the stairs, jubilant. The version of herself she can see looks like her old dark haired self, meanwhile when she looks down at her own hands, she seems to be some sort of shadow. Well aware this is a dream and the rest of the crew of the Heritage are fighting for their lives, Rydia turns around and starts running away, deeper into the trees.  

Searching for an exit, Rydia finds nothing but trees, hearing the voices of the rest of the Golden Grin in the distance behind her. Looking for a way out, she starts blasting at the trees, trying to create a pathway out. However this doesn’t seem to be successful, Rydia eventually giving up and heading back towards the group. As she draws closer, she can see the four of them gathering around the book, laid out on a large flat stone. Dark dragon scales have been used for the binding, and Galen manages to remove the lock from the book, ready to open it.

Approaching the group, Rydia calls out, all four turning towards her. “You’re fake, you’re fake, you’re me and you’re in trouble, and if you think I can have a nightmare after where I’ve been recently… well, good luck. How do I get out of here?” The past version of Rydia turns to her, asking what she is, but Rydia tells her it’s a really long story. The other version of her says they came from a small clearing off to the side, pointing it out to her. Rydia thanks her, before running off in that direction. As she does, she can hear a shockwave coming from behind her, but she continues running, the leaves falling from the trees around her as she leaps towards a bright leap, waking up back in the temple. 

Beck sees to healing Nerima as Bonzo, Petr and the rest of the lizardfolk deal with the remaining enraged black scales, the wall releasing Bonzobur as the couatl splits apart. As Sekkalok deals with the last hostile lizardfolk, a now conscious Galen moves towards Rydia, who is just waking up, still severely wounded from the fight. He asks if she’s okay, specifically asking if she’s alive, which Rydia answers with a sigh before confirming this to him. “Yeah, think so. What- where is the-” she starts to ask, before being quickly silenced as as Galen moves in to kiss her. All of Rydia’s eyes widen in shock before her two normal eyes close, leaning into it.

Lying on the ground for a long moment, Beck is eventually joined by Akulele, who uses her magic to help heal the worst of the wounds on the party. Akulele also wakes Nerima from her dream, before congratulating Beck on doing well. She relays that they intend to turn things around, now she knows Jakzi was using the baptisms to keep the men under control. Beck asks about the pool, Akulele saying all they really know is that Jakzi started collected the couatl blood from the temple and bringing it to the pool. They don’t know anything about the creature, but Beck knows the couatl supposedly died to form the Silver Flame, which keeps the Titans locked away. Beck thinks this is likely the recovered remains of one of the couatl, that was reincarnated through the blood, and immediately corrupted by [[Masvirik]]’s influence on this place. Due to its heritage, it could use its powers in service of Jakzi and Masvirik, corrupting those here. Akulele also explains ritual bathing in the blood pool was common in the Barracks, Akulele protecting herself with wards. After bathing, they would normally fight in the sandpits, sometimes to the death.

Beck suggests removing the pool, Akulele agreeing with the idea. He asks if there’s anything else she needs, Akulele saying they should be fine, and more than capable of handling [[Korlasz]] when he returns. She then tells Beck she’ll fetch his keys, leaving the chamber to retrieve them. 

Eventually breaking apart, Galen tells Rydia he saw her die, Rydia pausing for a moment before telling him she’s fine. She says she doesn’t think it was real, mentioning she saw their friends, and she knew it wasn’t them. Rydia then asks if Galen could give her a moment, thinking back on the worst moment from when she touched the book. She then uses encode thoughts, producing a memory strand before holding it up to the wall. However, the wall stands silent, which Rydia seems disappointed by, saying she was hoping to return the favour. “I don’t mean to sound morbid but I hope you see me die more often,” Rydia jokes, before immediately stumbling over her words, seeming to think better of the joke. Galen apologises if he’s seemed distant, Rydia immediately saying that she knows it’s a lot. Also fumbling his words, Galen denies this, admitting he just didn’t want to push her. There’s a long pause, Rydia considering this with a slight laugh. “I’m glad you did.”

Rydia points out they should leave, Galen agreeing with this before turning back towards to room, calling out to Beck to ask if they’re done. Beck confirms they’re just waiting on the keys, as Akulele returns holding two triangle shaped keys. She passes these to Petr, who thanks her and asks if they can go, as he could use some rest. Akulele confirms they’ve done more than enough, and after a brief discussion with Nerima the group discover she doesn’t have the third key, which was instead left with one of her companions. Nerima has a brief discussion with Akulele, who says there’s a Basilisk in the Administrative building above, which is likely where her friends are - safe, but turned to stone.

Nerima tells them they were stripped of their gear when they were captured in the Central Square, so there may be a chance that the key is there. Agreeing to check there on their way back to the Heritage, still parked up near the Amphitheater, the group head out of the Barracks after Beck takes the time to grab Jakzi’s sabre from her body, which appears to be magic. Bonzo also finds a small pouch of gunpowder on the body of one of the lizardfolk, which seems to be highly explosive.

Trying to stay out of sight as they head north, some of the group manage to spot the body of Azaka at the bottom of a cliff, in a broken state that suggests he fell from the cliff whilst trying to escape. Beck points this out, keen to collect his body before they leave. Arriving at the Central Square, there’s a large number of dead black scales, wreckage from Beck’s illusion. Nerima leads the way towards a tree at the side of the plaza, where there’s a pile of metal and gear. She fishes through it, dressing herself and recovering three small golden earpieces, although there’s no sign of a key. 

Deciding to deal with the rest of the search tomorrow, the group make their way back towards the airship, boarding the Hertiage and finding space for a grateful Nerima and [[Orvex]] to rest in the hold. Rydia takes the time to make dinner before the group crash from an exceptionally long day, Rydia keeping watch on deck in case anything happens.

As the sun sets across the deck, Galen joins her on watch, the two watching over a relatively calm jungle, accompanied by the sound of insects and bird calls. Rydia apologises for saying that she hoped Galen would see her die more often. “We know what that’s like. I was just… surprised.” Galen tells her she doesn’t need to apologise to him all the time, which cause Rydia to pause for a moment, holding back another apology. “I’m sorry if I made you feel- Things have changed, but how I feel about you hasn’t.” Rydia agrees with the sentiment, eventually asking what happens next. Galen responds that they need to get the keys and head to the temple, but Rydia tells him that’s not what she meant. When he asks what she did mean, Rydia pauses for a long moment before saying that she’ll think on it and get back to him. 

“I meant what I said. There is no universe I go anywhere you aren’t,” Galen tells her, Rydia eventually kissing him in response, the moment eventually broken by the loud cries of parrots across the jungle. Galen breaks off, saying he’ll go and get the next person on watch, but if Rydia ever wants to come downstairs she’s more than welcome - she doesn’t need to stay on deck all the time. There’s an awkward exchange about what Galen meant, before he eventually admits he just misses waking up next to her, immediately heading off to bed afterwards.

The rest of the night passes peacefully, with Petr joining Rydia for the second shift before Beck takes third, Rydia spotting movement in the trees as dawn draws closer. It’s a ways off, hidden by the foliage that means they can’t quite make out what it is. However, something seems to be approaching the city, possibly a group of people who should arrive within the day at the pace they’re travelling at. Beck and Rydia also notice the illusion vanish from another section of the city, Korlasz clearly still at work.

As morning rises, the group gather again on deck, Bonzo suffering from a severe bout of joint paint. Beck takes some time to look over Jakzi’s sabre, finding the golden weapon engraved with a flying snake. Clearly magical, Beck takes the time to attune to the weapon. Noticing the state Bonzo seems to be in, the group ask if he’s okay, Bonzo explaining he’s been feeling worse and worse lately, asking if the others have had the same. Rydia says she’s actually been feeling better, but she’s maybe not the best example. Bonzo says he feels like he’s losing his mind, unable to focus on anything. 

Overhearing the conversation, Nerima explains that [[Masvirik]]’s corruption spreads to everything - even them. Having a lot of complaints together is cause for concern, and they’ve seen people go insane from the effects. Nerima and her companions have a ritual to ward off the effects, but there’s little the party can do other than leave, or use Restoration spells to stave off the effects. Galen points out they’re not done yet, and Nerima offers to help with Restoration spells to try and assist with Bonzo’s situation. Rydia asks why they didn’t lead with this information, but Nerima explains they would have had to move half a day’s journey away to avoid the effects - that and she did shoot an arrow at their ship to try and warn them off.

Nerima sets about doing what she can to help Bonzo as Galen and Beck thank both Petr and Bonzo for saving them yesterday, after a close call with Marien. They agree it was mostly a team effort. They have concerns about what might wait in the temple, but Nerima assures them it’s been locked for a long time, meaning she’s confident there’s nothing inside - an assurance which is met with some skeptism by the crew.  

As they have this discussion, Galen receives a sending spell from Lady Ophelia, her voice ringing in his head. “Are you alright? I saw a vision of you yesterday, you looked bloodied. Now don’t go trudging into danger, you cannot die - you’re too important.” Pausing for a moment, Galen responds mentally, doing his best to not let onto the rest that he received a message. “So you’re keeping an eye on me with visions now, huh? I’ll get into as much danger as I want to.”

Nerima returns to the ship, having flown off to investigate the movement in the trees Beck pointed out - Nerima tells them this is the [[Poison Dusk]], who she contacted, telling them the Dawnshards are in danger. They’ve arrived to help, and are approaching the city now. Beck says the Dawnshards are still in danger, and Nerima explains the [[Poison Dusk]] are bringing Kyber crystal they can use to restore them - but if enough fall, it might be too late for that, or to prevent further corruption in [[Rashaak]]. 

Debating what to do first, the group agree to head back to the Barracks, flying the airship down there to collect Nerima’s associates. They figure they can request the help of the Black Scales in dealing with Korlasz as they try to recover the two dragonborn from the Basilisk’s lair. 

As they approach, they get a clearer view of the Administrative building, seeing a variety of dragonborn who have been turned to stone, twelve to fifteen littered throughout the space. Galen also spots the shadow of the Basilik in the corner of the ruined building, seemingly asleep in the shade. Deciding how to approach this, Nerima offers to pick out the person who was carrying the key so they can find him first. 

Lowering the ship down over the area, Beck casts a Silence spell on the Basilisk before Galen volunteers to head down and grab the statue, as he’s likely the quietest of the group. Rydia asks him to be careful, Galen assuring her he’ll be right back before climbing down the ladder towards the statue gallery. Half way down the ladder, the Basilisk seems unmoved, but off to the right, Galen can see the massive form of [[Rashaak]] erupt from the tar pit, wings flexing as he claws out of the tar, head resting on the top of the pillar, and the same corrupted rage in its eyes that lay within the Triceratops.
