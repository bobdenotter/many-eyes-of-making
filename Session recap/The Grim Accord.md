# The Grim Accord
They start making their way outside, emerging from the temple. Outside, there's an eerie silence as the sun is sinking, and [[Yondaar]] and [[Orvex]] meet up with them, directing their attention to the airship. "I started making sound as soon as I saw him, I'm sorry", Yondaar says, "I think he did some very bad damage to your ship."

Lamenting their bad luck, they head over to see what the damage is. A massive hole was torn into the front hull and the elemental ring also got damaged. Beck checks if the elemental spirit is still there, but though he can't see it, Bonzo assures him that it likely retreated to the engine, which is a failsafe he knows is in place for these set ups. 

Bonzo takes a look at the damage, quickly determining that it all seems fixable, but they'll need to find some raw materials. Wood, to fix the hull, as well as copper and some dragonshards to fix the elemental ring. It'll take a few days, but he thinks they can fix this relatively easily. 

Beck recalls they have a large copper gong in his doorknob, which he pulls out. It's enough copper to fix the elemental ring, which Beck also suggests they could try and shape with Bonzo's Heat Metal spell. As all of them are pretty tapped right now, they decide to gather up the supplies now and get to work on fixing things the following morning. 

They split up, Galen and Rydia heading in a south west direction, where they've seen shards of dragonshard on the ground, as Beck and Nerima fly off towards the woods atop the cliff to hopefully gather up some wood. Bonzo, Petr, Orvex and Yondaar stay behind at the airship. 

Having heard a noise from the direction they're heading earlier, Galen keeps an eye out, but doesn't really notice anything specific, neither he or Rydia spotting [[Rashaak]]. They do run into a group of [[Poison Dusk]] lizardfolk, who seem to be fixing up one of the dawnshards. 

The draconic gargoyles that flew out the temple are sitting on some of these dawnshards as the lizardfolk are setting up scaffolding, seemingly intent on fixing the broken shards. They've brought not only a large number of troops, but also triceratops, equipped with satchels full of dragonshards; it seems they've brought a construction crew as well as an attack force.

Galen approaches the lizardfolk, speaking to one that seems to be the leader. Some more lizardfolk approach as well, carrying shields seemingly made of tortoise shells, appearing hesitant about letting Galen and Rydia approach. "State your business," one says, in draconic, so Galen tells him exactly why they're here, saying he's with the crew of the Heritage and they're looking for some dragonshards to fix their ship.

He asks Rydia if she's also with the crew, which she confirms. The lizardfolk seems suspicious. "It is forbidden to take the dawnshards, as we told your leader." Galen asks who he means by that, the lizardfolk saying he means 'the half human shaman'. After some confusion, he goes on to say it's a halfling by the name of [[Irae]], Galen and Rydia recognising that name from the halfling they saw back in New Throne. 

They tell the lizardfolk they're not with this person, Galen attempting to reason with him to try and still get some shards for the airship. Though the lizardfolk remains cautious, he says he'll have his men look into all this and asks where Galen and Rydia will be staying, saying he'll find them at the airship later. They're not given dragonshards just yet, but he assures them that finding some won't be hard, he just wants to check some things out first.

Galen then asks how long ago the lizardfolk saw [[Irae]] and when they're told it's been about an hour, Galen and Rydia immediately start making their way back towards the ship, hoping to warn the others. On the way back, Rydia and Galen discuss Irae, trying to recall what they know about her. They know she was in contact with those other people who tried to set them up. 

Meanwhile, Beck and Nerima prepare to fly up and chop down some trees for wood. He finds some handaxes in the hold of the ship, giving two to Bonzo when he suggests he thinks he can make something that'll speed up the process of chopping down the trees. Beck and Nerima go ahead with Nerima's own axe and Beck now having a handaxe, finding some trees and beginning the process of chopping one down. 

As they're chopping away, Beck notices a sound. He flies up, using the wings from the earpiece Nerima gave him, and soon spots two heads poking out of the canopy of trees. Upon closer inspection, both heads seem to belong to the same troll, and they're speaking to each other in Giant, a language Beck does not speak. 

Upon spotting Beck, one of the heads decides to throw a large wooden club in his direction, but it goes wide and is sent falling to the ground in the city below. He flies back to Nerima, telling her about what he just found and suggesting that they head back to the others. They fly back, picking up the troll's club on the way back so they have at least some wood to show for. 

Back at the ship, Petr spots a pair of velociraptors out in the city, noting that they seem to be wearing saddles, which would suggest someone is around. He heads down into the hold of the ship, where Bonzo is working on the axe invention, telling him what he saw. "I was being busy up top and as I was wiping the sweat of my brow, I noticed two velociraptors with saddles ... There might be people nearby, it didn't sit well with me. I thought we could check it out together?"

Bonzo, knowing that Petr has been seeing things lately, goes up to check for himself. As they're heading up past the engine room, they notice that the wind swirling around in the engine because of the elemental is quite loud. Getting up on deck, Bonzo doesn't see the velociraptors himself. "Keep an eye out, warn me if you see them again," Bonzo says, Petr admitting that he can't blame him for not taking him seriously right now. Bonzo then asks him if he's okay. "I think I am. I think I'm fine. I'm fine yeah, like 80% sure I'm fine." Bonzo doesn't quite believe him, but tells him to just keep an eye out.

Wanting a somewhat quieter place to work, Bonzo moves his work to the galley, but as he moves there, he spots a puddle of water in the hallway. Not quite trusting it, he goes to investigate, moving up a floor to see if there's a leak of sorts, but he can't find anything. Petr asks him what he's looking at, so he shares what he's found and the two of them quickly become convinced that there's someone aboard the ship. 

They ask Orvex and Yondaar if they've seen anything, but they say the dragon was the only thing they noticed. Bonzo and Petr then head below deck again, deciding to do a sweep of the ship.

As they're looking through all the rooms below deck, they eventually make their way back to Bonzo's workplace, where he notes that some of his papers are out of order. Bonzo casts Detect Magic, but doesn't pick up on anything. As they're still looking around, suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway of the workshop.

"Hello, Ashbringer."

Addressing the disembodied voice, Bonzo asks who this is and why they're calling him Ashbringer. "You don't know me, but I know you. There were a lot of my friends in the Glowing Kipper that night..." the voice trails off, then goes on to mention a contraption that Bonzo made for the [[Daask]]. Bonzo in turn asks the voice what she's here for, and how she found him.

"I'm here mainly for you." She then says she's here for revenge, to which Bonzo asks her if she's here with the Daask. Petr asks Bonzo if he knows who this is, to which Bonzo says he doesn't know, but he does know what she's talking about. 

Petr calls out to the voice, asking her to introduce herself. He and Bonzo see the door open, but don't hear much else as the engine is still making a lot of noise. They still chase after whoever this is, no longer hearing the voice. They head into the hold, Bonzo spotting a wet boot print, leading through an open door. 

"Petr, you coming?" Petr follows and both of them head into that room. As soon as they peek their head through the door, they see a halfling woman with brown hair with reddish tips. She throws a tiny glimmer of light their way that explodes in their face, casting Fireball as an explosion of fire erupts in the room.

As this is happening, Galen, Rydia as well as Beck and Nerima are all approaching the ship, all of them hearing this Fireball go off and picking up their pace, attempting to get near the ship. As combat ensues between Petr, Bonzo and Irae, Beck lands atop the deck of the ship, calling out to whoever can hear him to ask what's going on. 

Galen and Rydia attempt to run in as well, though a hyena jumps out of some bushes near them, attempting to stop them. Galen tries to keep the hyena back, telling Rydia to get to the ship as from atop a roof, a third figure appears, drawing a bow and taking three shots at Beck, knocking him unconscious. 

Nerima flies in after Beck, managing to get him back up and after a moment of being torn, Beck sees Irae running away from the ship and attempts to go after her. She counterspells his Suggestion spell as Petr, Bonzo as well as Betsy rush out of the ship, chasing after her as well. 

Bonzo attempts to catapult some rubble at Irae, which misses, but does hits a figure behind her that was missing in the shadows. An elven woman steps out, with long black hair and frozen tears on her cheeks, Beck instantly recognising her as [[Athelonia]]. 

Combat continues, the group trying to get closer together as they're spread out across this area. Rydia manages to make her way up to where Irae and Athelonia are, grappling the former as Beck calls out to the latter, asking her if this was what she meant when she said she'd see him in [[Haka'thorvak]]. She does seem to recognise him, and looks from him to Rydia and back. 

"It was, though I didn't think we were going to have to fight you", Athelonia says, to which Beck points out that they don't need to be fighting. Irae clearly disagrees, calling out that she has a problem with 'the gnome'. Beck says that means they have trouble with her in turn, viciously mocking her as Petr also calls out: "If you have trouble with the gnome, you have trouble with all of us!"

After Petr attacks Athelonia with a Chill Touch, she casually walks up to where Rydia is still holding on to Irae, moving her shadow wreathed greatsword up and placing it under Rydia's chin. She then turns to Beck. "We can keep doing this the hard way, but we're not leaving here without that Stone". 

Thinking that he's seen what she wants to do with the stone, Beck tells her no. "I had a dream what you might use that for and I don't think I'm going to give it to you". She says that's a shame, before attacking Rydia with her greatsword. Bonzo tears up a little, looking over at his friends, before commanding Betsy to run into command as he takes a few shots himself as well. 

As he manages to hit Irae pretty badly, flames ignite around her before she casts another Fireball, which hits and knocks Rydia, Petr and Beck unconscious and disables Betsy as well.

Galen's still a little away from the rest, dealing with the wildshaped gnoll, but he manages to get away from him, rushing up to the others. Taking in his surroundings, he calls out to Athelonia and Irae, asking them what the hell they want. 

"I'm very glad you did the mopping up for us at this place. We didn't get the headstart we wanted at first but ... we would like the Eye now", Athelonia says. Galen asks her what she's going to do with it, which she seems unwilling to share. "I'll tell you what my fucking business is; what're you going to do with it?" Galen says, though it doesn't impress Athelonia much. 

She proceeds to point out that they seem outnumbered, to which Galen points out she doesn't know where it is. "If you kill us all, you'll never get it." Athelonia seems to recognise that he makes a point, before she holds up her hand, signalling for her people to hold. 

The half-orc doesn't see her gesture yet, still taking a shot at Bonzo, hitting him once as Nerima takes her chance to fly up, using Thaumaturgy to call out in a lizardfolk war cry, hoping to alert her people. She then starts heading in the direction Galen knows the poison dusk lizardfolk are. 

Athelonia approaches Galen, suggesting they drop their weapons so they can talk. Galen manages to convince her to let him stabilise his friends. "I'll let you stounch their wounds, sure. Your shortlived friends don't matter that much to me." She calls of her people, urging Irae in particular to stay calm, saying she understands its hard to let go of what Bonzo did. 

With things somewhat calmed down, Bonzo casts Spare the Dying on Beck before Galen uses a healing potion to get Beck up. He in turn gets Petr up, who then heals Rydia, leaving the whole party at least conscious again. Bonzo walks up to Betsy, attempting to fix her and as he's near Irae, she asks him to please not blow anyone up. "That's what you did!" Bonzo objects.

A tense situation follows, during which Nerima manages to get away properly, despite the half-orc and the gnoll chasing after her. Those who were just brought back from unconsciousness aren't fully aware of the tentative truce, so Rydia attacks Irae again, then uses her telekinesis to shove Athelonia away from herself after Athelonia attempts to take a swing at her. 

"That wasn't the deal", Athelonia calls out, a confused Beck asking what's going on as Petr asks Rydia to stop attacking Irae and the others, as they're at a disadvantage right now. "Are we fighting or not?" Beck then asks, to which Athelonia admits she thought this was going to be a clean transaction. "The stone for your lives."

Beck asks her what she intends on using the stone for, to which she says she's not using it. [[Sora Tharaza]] is the one who will be using it. When she mentions that name, Beck instantly says no. She asks if that's his answer, to which Beck says "Let's just say that I had a vision, and you mentioned [[The Daughters of Sora Kell]] and you intended to use the stone to cause another Mourning. Are you surprised I'm saying no?"

She says that she is indeed a bit surprised. "I think people should know when they're conquered." Beck continues questioning Athelonia, asking her if she really thinks more people deserve to die like that. "What makes you think I want to cause another Mourning?" Beck says everything else in his dream seemed real, so that might as well be real as well. Athelonia questions to logic of her wanting to cause another Mourning, as her entire kingdom fell. 

As Rydia continues munching on Irae, the halfling misty stepping away. Beck calls out Athelonia for not being able to control her people. She tells him the same thing, Beck pointing out these aren't his people and he doesn't control them. 

With everyone now seemingly somewhat calmed down, Athelonia says that it would seem like they are at a disadvantage. "We can keep talking, or you can give me what I want." Beck points out she doesn't know which one of them has it, if they even have it, before asking her once again what she's going to do with it.

She says she's giving it to Sora Tharaza, though she doesn't seem to know what they will do with it in turn. Beck questions why she's working for someone else. "Because Sora Tharaza is the only person in Khorvaire who doesn't stand to gain from destroying everything." Beck turns to Galen, asking what he knows about Sora Theraza, but in the heat of the moment Galen can't recall much.

"You might not believe this, but we are just doing a job for her. I know that this thing was involved in the Mourning; I also know it was used for something it wasn't supposed to be used for. I know that Sora Tharaza wants to use it for ... conversations," Athelonia says, Beck asking who she wishes to speak to. "Too many to name."

"I promise you I'm not going to destroy the world," Athelonia then adds and as they're talking, Galen notices poison dusk lizardfolk hiding away in the bushes. They soon make their presence known, as fifteen or so step out with drawn bows, aiming them at Athelonia and her group. 

In the distance, another group of poison dusk approaches carrying a slaughtered gnoll, closing in on their position.
