# The Grim Accord
They start making their way outside, emerging from the temple. Outside, there's an eerie silence as the sun is sinking, and [[Yondaar]] and [[Orvex]] meet up with them, directing their attention to the airship. "I started making sound as soon as I saw him, I'm sorry", Yondaar says, "I think he did some very bad damage to your ship."

Lamenting their bad luck, they head over to see what the damage is. A massive hole was torn into the front hull and the elemental ring also got damaged. Beck checks if the elemental spirit is still there, but though he can't see it, Bonzo assures him that it likely retreated to the engine, which is a failsafe he knows is in place for these set ups. 

Bonzo takes a look at the damage, quickly determining that it all seems fixable, but they'll need to find some raw materials. Wood, to fix the hull, as well as copper and some dragonshards to fix the elemental ring. As they're dividing themselves up in groups to try and find these things, Beck recalls they have a large copper gong in his doorknob, which he pulls out.
