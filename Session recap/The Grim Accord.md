# The Grim Accord
They start making their way outside, emerging from the temple. Outside, there's an eerie silence as the sun is sinking, and [[Yondaar]] and [[Orvex]] meet up with them, directing their attention to the airship. "I started making sound as soon as I saw him, I'm sorry", Yondaar says, "I think he did some very bad damage to your ship."

Lamenting their bad luck, they head over to see what the damage is. A massive hole was torn into the front hull and the elemental ring also got damaged. Beck checks if the elemental spirit is still there, but though he can't see it, Bonzo assures him that it likely retreated to the engine, which is a failsafe he knows is in place for these set ups. 

Bonzo takes a look at the damage, quickly determining that it all seems fixable, but they'll need to find some raw materials. Wood, to fix the hull, as well as copper and some dragonshards to fix the elemental ring. It'll take a few days, but he thinks they can fix this relatively easily. 

Beck recalls they have a large copper gong in his doorknob, which he pulls out. It's enough copper to fix the elemental ring, which Beck also suggests they could try and shape with Bonzo's Heat Metal spell. As all of them are pretty tapped right now, they decide to gather up the supplies now and get to work on fixing things the following morning. 

They split up, Galen and Rydia heading in a south west direction, where they've seen shards of dragonshard on the ground, as Beck and Nerima fly off towards the woods atop the cliff to hopefully gather up some wood. Bonzo, Petr, Orvex and Yondaar stay behind at the airship. 

Having heard a noise from the direction they're heading earlier, Galen keeps an eye out, but doesn't really notice anything specific, neither he or Rydia spotting [[Rashaak]]. They do run into a group of [[Poison Dusk]] lizardfolk, who seem to be fixing up one of the dawnshards. 

The draconic gargoyles that flew out the temple are sitting on some of these dawnshards as the lizardfolk are setting up scaffolding, seemingly intent on fixing the broken shards. They've brought not only a large number of troops, but also triceratops, equipped with satchels full of dragonshards; it seems they've brought a construction crew as well as an attack force.

Galen approaches the lizardfolk, speaking to one that seems to be the leader. Some more lizardfolk approach as well, carrying shields seemingly made of tortoise shells, appearing hesitant about letting Galen and Rydia approach. "State your business," one says, in draconic, so Galen tells him exactly why they're here, saying he's with the crew of the Heritage and they're looking for some dragonshards to fix their ship.

He asks Rydia if she's also with the crew, which she confirms. The lizardfolk seems suspicious. "It is forbidden to take the dawnshards, as we told your leader." Galen asks who he means by that, the lizardfolk saying he means 'the half human shaman'. After some confusion, he goes on to say it's a halfling by the name of [[Irae]], Galen and Rydia recognising that name from the halfling they saw back in New Throne. 

They tell the lizardfolk they're not with this person, Galen attempting to reason with him to try and still get some shards for the airship. Though the lizardfolk remains cautious, he says he'll have his men look into all this and asks where Galen and Rydia will be staying, saying he'll find them at the airship later. They're not given dragonshards just yet, but he assures them that finding some won't be hard, he just wants to check some things out first.

Galen then asks how long ago the lizardfolk saw [[Irae]] and when they're told it's been about an hour, Galen and Rydia immediately start making their way back towards the ship, hoping to warn the others. On the way back, Rydia and Galen discuss Irae, trying to recall what they know about her. They know she was in contact with those other people who tried to set them up. 

Meanwhile, Beck and Nerima prepare to fly up and chop down some trees for wood. He finds some handaxes in the hold of the ship, giving two to Bonzo when he suggests he thinks he can make something that'll speed up the process of chopping down the trees. Beck and Nerima go ahead with Nerima's own axe and Beck now having a handaxe, finding some trees and beginning the process of chopping one down. 

As they're chopping away, Beck notices a sound. He flies up, using the wings from the earpiece Nerima gave him, and soon spots two heads poking out of the canopy of trees. Upon closer inspection, both heads seem to belong to the same troll, and they're speaking to each other in Giant, a language Beck does not speak. 

Upon spotting Beck, one of the heads decides to throw a large wooden club in his direction, but it goes wide and is sent falling to the ground in the city below. He flies back to Nerima, telling her about what he just found and suggesting that they head back to the others. They fly back, picking up the troll's club on the way back so they have at least some wood to show for. 

Back at the ship, Petr spots a pair of velociraptors out in the city, noting that they seem to be wearing saddles, which would suggest someone is around. He heads down into the hold of the ship, where Bonzo is working on the axe invention, telling him what he saw. "I was being busy up top and as I was wiping the sweat of my brow, I noticed two velociraptors with saddles ... There might be people nearby, it didn't sit well with me. I thought we could check it out together?"

Bonzo, knowing that Petr has been seeing things lately, goes up to check for himself. As they're heading up past the engine room, they notice that the wind swirling around in the engine because of the elemental is quite loud. Getting up on deck, Bonzo doesn't see the velociraptors himself. "Keep an eye out, warn me if you see them again," Bonzo says, Petr admitting that he can't blame him for not taking him seriously right now. Bonzo then asks him if he's okay. "I think I am. I think I'm fine. I'm fine yeah, like 80% sure I'm fine." Bonzo doesn't quite believe him, but tells him to just keep an eye out.

Wanting a somewhat quieter place to work, Bonzo moves his work to the galley, but as he moves there, he spots a puddle of water in the hallway. Not quite trusting it, he goes to investigate, moving up a floor to see if there's a leak of sorts, but he can't find anything. Petr asks him what he's looking at, so he shares what he's found and the two of them quickly become convinced that there's someone aboard the ship. 

They ask Orvex and Yondaar if they've seen anything, but they say the dragon was the only thing they noticed. Bonzo and Petr then head below deck again, deciding to do a sweep of the ship.

As they're looking through all the rooms below deck, they eventually make their way back to Bonzo's workplace, where he notes that some of his papers are out of order. Bonzo casts Detect Magic, but doesn't pick up on anything. As they're still looking around, suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway of the workshop.

"Hello, Ashbringer."

Addressing the disembodied voice, Bonzo asks who this is. "You don't know me, but I know you. There were a lot of my friends in the Glowing Kipper that night..." the voice trails off, then goes on to mention a contraption that Bonzo made for the [[Daask]].
