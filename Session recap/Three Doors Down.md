# Three Doors Down
Galen wastes no time in rushing over to Esme, untying her and making sure she’s okay. The first thing Esme does is ask him what he just did and how, to which Galen simply tells her it’s a long story, and that he never should’ve gone to Karrnath. Lina runs in, checking in on her wife as Galen and Petr get a chance to look around the room they’re in. It seems to be the room in which they recount all the poker chips and keep a number of binders, the latter seeming to contain ‘leverage’ on certain people. 

Petr suggests that Lina and Esme go home, saying he and the others can go after Thelos. Lina seems somewhat reluctant, pointing out Thelos is hers to protect as well, but a look from Esme is quick to shut her up and make her agree to go home. Galen then calls out to all the others, asking if they’re doing okay.

Everyone confirms this, Beck pointing out that one of the House Thuranni agents got away, adding that they might want to hurry up if they want to make sure Thelos is safe as she’s probably ran off to warn the others. 

Downstairs, Rydia speaks to Therrad, who asks her what they want. She simply explains that someone got kidnapped and they’re here to resolve that, to which Therrad doesn’t argue and keeps quiet. She then helps herself to some of the money from behind the bar, grabbing 25 gold for their troubles.

Back upstairs, Lina starts casting Teleportation Circle as Galen makes sure Esme really is okay, asking her what happened. She explains that she was at home, and that she heard stumbling downstairs. Before she could make it down there herself to check it out, she was grabbed and taken. Galen asks both her and Lina to be careful, suggesting maybe home isn’t the safest place right now. 

He then spots Esme’s name in one of the ledgers, her name as well as a Viceroy Calyden being described as having a rivalry of sorts. He points this out to her and she says she’s pretty sure that they’ll have some ‘dirt’ on Lina as well, but none of it is really anything of note. She suggests that most of the things in these ledgers would already be public knowledge. 

Lina then finishes up the circle and the two of them leave. Galen picks the locks on some lockboxes in the room, finding a total of 120 gold, as well as two small gems who seem to be worth about 600 gold each. Petr then takes the time to explore some of the casino, finding 23 silver on a table that seems to be inside a security room of sorts. The next room over is an observation room, with large glass panes in the floors offering a view of the betting tables on the floor below. He makes his way towards another door, but something seems off about it, so he doesn’t enter alone, instead heading back to tell Galen about it.

Meanwhile, Bonzo takes the time to look over the mechanical beholder downstairs. He recognises it seems to be based on a basic Shield Guardian design, but can’t figure out much more detail about it. Rydia finishes her drink at the bar. 

Beck, having fully expected everyone to come with him to find Thelos, somewhat impatiently reminds everyone that they seem to be under some time pressure there, which seems to jump everyone back in motion as they leave. He goes to find a skycoach as Bonzo is sad to find that outside, Betsy has been taken apart for parts. 

He asks Beck for the doorknob, putting both Betsy and a part of the mechanical beholder that he took inside it before they all find a skycoach to take them to middle Dura. The difference between the two neighbourhoods is instantly noticeable, this one notably much more middle class. The Bazaar, their destination, is very crowded, and Beck doesn’t know exactly where the place is they’re going to, he just knows that it’ll be behind an unassuming brown door. 

It doesn’t take them too long to spot the door, though as they’re looking around, Beck also notes two cloaked figures that seem to be keeping an eye on them. He points them out to the others, before turning back to the door and attempting to kick it in. He fails, Rydia offering to kick it in instead, and she does succeed. They head in, instantly met with heat coming from molten rock on both sides of a metallic walkway that leads to a platform in the center, and a forge. 

There, they spot a lady and a warforged in golden armor speaking to Valindra, who seems to be trying to warn them about what just happened in the Anvil. Beck calls out, asking for Jonah or Merrix and, having overheard what Valindra just said, urges the woman and the warforged to not start anything, as they did just kill a number of people back at the Anvil. 

Valindra, displeased by how she’s having trouble convincing the woman and the warforged, casts a spell on something in the middle of the room, suggesting to the large clock-like construct that comes to life that it should protect her. Rydia calls out to the two others, who seem to belong to House Cannith, asking them to just bring out Thelos. The two of them don’t seem to want to fight, yet the charmed construct moves to attack the group. 

As the group tries to defend themselves, the warforged, Wrench, considers them attacking the construct as a hostile action, so he moves in to join the fight, though he’s soon taken out the equation as Rydia blasts him into the molten lava. 

This is enough to convince the other House Cannith person, Thaya, to try and put an end to this. “That’s enough!” she calls out, turning on Valindra and whacking her in the head, making her lose concentration on her spell, which in turn makes the large construct stand down. Two other House Thuranni spies, the ones that Beck spotted before, have moved into the room as well, but after some intimidation Valindra and her two cronies are convinced to stand down and walk away. 

Thaya then agrees to show the group up to meet with the ‘client’, but only after retrieving her warforged friend from the lava, which the crew helps her do. They then take the elevator up to the next floor, the open elevator showing a view of numerous work benches and artificers inside this compound, seeming to be running all sorts of experiments. 

The elevator comes to a stop and they get out, noting stairs that lead further up. They take the stairs, the floor they come out on offering a view of the Bazaar through large arches on the outside of it. They’re met with bright purple and orange light as well and as they make it to the top of the stairs, they spot Thelos, seemingly accompanied by a small construct. 

There’s a few other familiar faces inside the room; Lady Dahlia, as well as the man in black that chased after the group back in Gatherhold. They’re accompanied by a large warforged as well. The crew addresses them, the man in black doing most of the talking for the others. They seem to think that they have what they came for, or at the very least they’ll make due with what they got. 

Throughout this conversation, Dahlia is eyeing Galen, who winds up calling her out, asking her what she wants. She says that he used her, mentioning that Ophelia told her about what happened with Saedra as well, and that he freed a God of Death. Galen offers some explanation, telling her that Saedra crashed a party and not the other way around. He also notes that Ophelia is his mother, which seems to surprise Dahlia. 

Dahlia states that the Sanguine Council have a lot of say in things, clarifying that they do not revere death, instead seeing it as an absolute end. Galen urges her to leave his business with the Sanguine Council to him, and it seems he’s given Dahlia a few things to think about.

Meanwhile, the man in black, referred to by Dahlia as Prow, attempts to clarify some things about what happened back in Gatherhold. He tells the crew that he was never after all of them, he was specifically asked to go after Fianin. He asks Beck if he doesn’t want to know why that is, Beck telling him that he doesn’t care. Prow compliments his loyalty, but then goes on to explain that Fianin is the one who interrupted the ritual with the crystal and directly caused the Mourning.

During this conversation, Rydia checks in with Thelos telepathically, who tells her that he did give these people the information they asked for. He also shares that the Boromar clan stole orchids from a Daask warehouse that was apparently full of it. 

As Dahlia and Prow are willing to let Thelos walk out, the crew gathers him and they walk out. On their way out, Thelos makes eye contact with Rydia, who checks with him telepathically again. He tells her that whilst he did make these people the potions they asked for, he messed with them, making them less potent. As such, theirs should only last an hour and a half, not giving them much time to explore the Mournland. 

As they continue making their way out, Beck apologises to Thelos, saying he never expected them to come after people. “I thought they would simply show up and ask you for the recipe, as opposed to kidnap you and force you to make some of it,” he adds. Thelos accepts his apology, thanking the crew for coming to get him. Though he doesn’t think they would hurt him, he also doesn’t think they were planning on letting him go anytime soon. 

Knowing all of this was ordered by Jonah, Beck tries to recall where Jonah lives and remembers roughly where it is. They find a skycoach for Thelos, sending him on his way, before finding a skycoach for themselves and taking that to Jonah’s apartment. 

They speak to a receptionist, who calls up to tell Jonah that he has visitors, but Jonah replies that he doesn’t want to see anyone. Beck asks what apartment Jonah lives in, and though the receptionist won’t tell them, Rydia’s detect thoughts makes it clear she’s thinking of apartment 29c. With the apartment number, they make their way up, ignoring the receptionist’s protests and her warnings of calling the city guard. 

Though Galen offers to pick a lock, Beck instead asks Rydia if she might want to kick the door in again, which she does, first kicking and then eldritch blasting it open. They call out to Jonah, who seems somewhat surprised to see them. 

Beck and Galen take the lead as they tell Jonah off for what happened, Jonah apparently not having known that the people he hired would go as far as to kidnap Esme d’Lyrander and Thelos. He claims that’s not what he told them to do, he just expected them to ‘take care of it’, Beck pointing out that’s almost worse and saying it’s still his responsibility. 

Rydia points out that the only reason Jonah is still alive is because Beck likes him, adding that he’s on thin ice even with Beck at this point. Beck expresses frustration and confusion about how they’ve been trying to help Jonah and House Cannith, and all they seem to get in return is people spying on them and their friends getting kidnapped. 

Jonah claims it was all Merrix’s idea and that he tried to talk him out of it, but it didn’t work. Beck says it’s unfortunate that Merrix seems to be their best bet when it comes to House Cannith leadership, Jonah pointing out that Therala might still be an option as well. He goes on to suggest that she cares about making profit a lot, so if they could perhaps set up some sort of deal between her and House Lyrander, they could at least get in Therala’s good graces.

Sighing, Beck reminds Jonah that he did just kidnap Esme d’Lyrander, so setting up some sort of favorable meeting there might be tricky. He does point out it’s not a terrible idea in theory. 

After some more talk about how Jonah seems utterly incompetent, Galen suggests that for now, perhaps the best thing is for Jonah to convince Merrix to delay any of their own expeditions into the Mournland until after the crew comes back from their mission. Jonah agrees to this and it seems he really will try to talk Merrix into this, though Beck has his doubts about whether or not Jonah will actually pull it off. 

With frustrations aired and things somewhat resolved, most of the crew start heading out, Beck staying behind for a moment to speak to Jonah in private. He asks about what Prow said about Fianin, Jonah confirming that is indeed the reason he sent someone after Fianin. Reliable sources apparently saw her that day. 

As captain of Jonah’s personal guard, she would escort him to place even Beck wouldn’t go, and one of those places was underneath Making. On one of said trips to Making, she made herself scarce, seemingly to mess with something with the crystal, and the next day is when the Mourning happened. 

He then asks Beck if he knows where Fianin is, which Beck denies, convincingly so. He then takes his leave as well, joining up with the rest of the crew as they head back to the airship. 

The following day and a half, everyone runs some last errands before they head of to the Mournland. Bonzo goes to pick up something he ordered from a shop, finding the shop in disarray, partially destroyed and completely looted. Looking around, he finds some gnoll hairs, knowing that the Daask are known to employ some gnolls. 

He then goes to visit his father as well as the custodian at the temple. He tells his father that he’s going to the Mournland, his father asking him if he can keep an eye out for any followers of the Lord of the Blades. He pulls out a paper with some interview questions, hoping that Bonzo might be able to ask said questions to any of said followers. Bonzo isn’t sure that’ll work, but he promises he’ll try.

He then goes to speak to the custodian, speaking to him for a moment before asking for some guidance, or a blessing of sorts. The custodian agrees, taking Bonzo’s wrench and making some adjustments to it. He hands it back to Bonzo then, saying it’ll allow him to speak to his God one time, to ask for advice.

Bonzo then asks about the armor that he got to borrow the last time he was here, asking if he could borrow it again. The custodian says no; he’s more than happy to lend it out to those needing it, but he’s afraid that there’s a chance that Bonzo might not make it back from the Mournland. 

Meanwhile, Petr makes sure to prepare the sumac leaves that will help with spotting manifest zones. He then talks to Beck, who asks him what he makes of the whole Fianin thing. Petr points out that it seems unlike the Fianin he knows and when Beck asks if they should perhaps write to her, he suggests that maybe that’s not the best idea right now. They agree not to reach out to her right now, but perhaps pay her a visit sometime when they get back from the Mournland. 

Somewhere else in the ship, Galen and Rydia talk. Galen asks Rydia if she thinks he’s a monster, Rydia saying that she feels somewhat ill equipped to answer that question. She does point out that looks have nothing to do with whether or not you’re a monster, listing Jonah as well as Prow as examples. “The way we look, as disfigured as we might be, doesn’t make us bad people.” 

Galen says it’s not that, instead explaining that he feels like he’s been fighting against as well as ignoring what he can do for a long time now. He’s very aware of the fact that he painfully and violently murdered the guard who threatened Esme, noting that was his own doing, even if the hand moved on its own during it. 

Rydia says that she thinks the moment they start enjoying this is when it becomes dangerous. “As long as we keep wondering if we’re doing the right thing, we’re already doing better than most people,” she points out. Galen goes on to say he’s just tired of running. All of this seems to be happening to him and he wants to start feeling like he’s in control of it. 

“She made me into a weapon. I want to be one.” Rydia then points out that, even if he hadn’t had the hand, Galen likely would’ve used his gun or some other means to kill that guard. She then adds that she too would like to figure out what she is and why she can do some of the things she can do, saying she might want to talk to Vvaraak about it.

Galen says that he did ask Erandis about it, who suggested that some of what she can do might be more tied to the Daelkyr than to Vvaraak. The two of them continue talking, discussing the Eyes as well as everyone’s motivations, noting how Erandis and Vvaraak might actually be the most sensible out of everyone after these eyes.
