# The Dreamwalker

The words linger in the air for a second, before they start repeating themselves. “At night, a creeping darkness will come, at night, a creeping darkness will come…” Beck and D4 discuss what it might be, Beck suggesting that it might be a warning of sorts. Outside of the captain, who’s on the deck of the ship, everyone else has retreated for the night.

As Beck and D4 are still staring at the docent, listening to the words repeat themselves, the airship suddenly comes to a dead stop, awakening everyone else aboard as well. D4 and Beck quickly run upstairs, Beck calling out to the captain, though there’s no response. They start running faster, D4 reaching the deck before Beck does. Looking around, they realise they seem to be in the middle of nowhere, and that the ropeladder from the ship has been dropped and, as they look over the edge, they can see the captain climbing down.

She doesn’t quite look like herself; blue light is emanating from her face, her eye sockets seeming almost hollow, strange blueish liminescent gas coming from them. She does look up when D4 calls out to her, but keeps going down, so Beck quickly follows, D4 sending his Zoomer after her as well.

Woken up by the sudden halt of the ship, the others join D4 on the deck, who quickly tells them what he knows. “The captain seems to be rather odd, she’s climbing down there, Beck’s going after her.” Having now reached the bottom of the ladder, the captain starts heading towards a canyon of sorts, though most of the group can’t see much of where she’s going because of it being dark outside.

D4 calls out to Beck, asking if he needs help, which he says he does, so the others start following down. Petr casts Feather Fall on all four of them and jumps overboard, D4 and then Rydia and Galen following suit.

As Beck follows the captain into the canyon, pieces of rock start to illuminate with markings and symbols that Beck recognises, having seem similar ones on the back of Lorna’s diary he found before. The illuminated markings light up two massive statues, engraved into the rock. He keeps following the captain as the rest of the group follows behind as well.

The captain is not responding to Beck at all, walking forward. Taking in his surroundings, Beck doesn’t hear anything, deducing that it doesn’t immediately seem very dangerous. He then comes across absolutely enormous skulls, as well as more different sizes bones, the captain weaving a path between them.

Whilst the canyon started out pretty wide, it’s starting to narrow up ahead. Having caught up to the captain now, Beck casts Detect Thoughts, trying to figure out what’s going on in the captain’s mind. He quickly realises that the thoughts are not Fianin’s; her mind is not her own. He strangely senses a form of relief as a base emotion of whoever these thoughts belong to.

The rest of the group is catching up, all coming through into this boneyard, noticing some of the sculptures as well. Rydia recognises the Giant runes, able to read them as well. The sculptures are largely carved into the rock, not actual statues; all of the reliefs are accompanied by this strange blue glow. The reliefs contain really strange curvy patterns, that almost remind the group of the creature they saw projected by D4’s Zoomer, but not as scary.

The runes read “All hail the Dreamwalker.” Rydia shares this with the others, and they briefly discuss whether or not this place is connected to the creature they saw. The reliefs also depict a struggle, between massive humanoids that are clutching their foreheads, seeming to toil with their own dreams. They also show a single massive humanoid, a Giant, with an elongated forehead, an orb floating above his head, sort of leading the way of these other giant creatures. It clearly shows Giants following this one person.

D4 points out that it seems like the captain is in danger and they should stop her, Galen pointing out he’s pretty sure they’re all in danger. Beck shares what he read in the captain’s thoughts, and D4 points out he thinks this is what the ball was warning them off. Their discussion is interrupted by sudden voices, Galen realising they’re coming from behind them: Er nabyar Arag. Er nabyar ARAG!

Beck asks Rydia if she can understand this as well, to which Rydia says she can’t, unless they ask them kindly to write it down. Beck instead casts Comprehend Languages, the voices around him warping into a language he understands. “They come to steal from Arag,” the voices say, Beck telling the group that they think they’re there to steal something.

The voices are now coming from multiple directions and as Beck shares what the voices say, a massive, near translucent spirit of a grey-ish giant appears, grabbing at Beck with its spectral hand, hitting him hard. Combat ensues as two more giants appear, one of them targeting Rydia and hitting, who retaliates by changing shape, the by now somewhat familiar to everyone tentacles and eyes appearing as she moves inbetween the two nearly appeared giants.

She casts Arms of Hadar, though soon realises the tentacles emerging from the spell don’t do a lot of damage; they do grapple the giants though, holding them in place. A fourth giant joins the fight, but the group eventually emerges victorious, Galen strangely gaining four blue spirits that shoot into his stomach every time a giant spectre dissolves. During combat, Beck, with Comprehend Languages still up, overhears the giant spectres speaking amongst themselves; they speak of protecting the ‘vessel’, calling each other by their names: Azus, Maun, Ogar and Vraos.

During the fight, the captain attempts to keep moving, D4 and the others chasing after her and by the time the last of the giant spectres is dealt with, D4 has her grappled. With combat over, Rydia climbs down from where she moved up one of the canyons, inspecting Galen, having seen the spirits go right into him. Galen assures her he’s fine, pointing out they have other priorities right now, promising they can talk about this later.

The captain is still trying to get away, D4 holding on to her as Beck and Galen take a closer look at the captain to try and deduce what exactly is going on with her. It seems like the captain is possessed, but the nature of the possession might not be evil in origin. This place is clearly eerie, but also beautiful in a strange kind of way; the markings in the spaces around them are telling a story. Both Beck and Galen get the feeling the captain is trying to lead them away.

They decide to let her go and follow her, as neither of them know how to fix this either. D4 lets her go, and they follow after her. In the round area they find themselves in, there’s a massive glowing skull lying in the sand, but the artwork on the walls is also quite revealing. They see the same strange giantkind figure from before, the orb floating above him, peering into a large crystal. Out of the crystal, strange squiggly lines emerge, familiar from the previous artwork. There’s also images of dragons, and images of elves.

Galen realises that he’s familiar with some of the imagery. He’s overheard stories in Gatherhold, having learned that whilst the plains are vast, they aren’t empty. Talenta halflings just avoid a lot of places, as they fear places are haunted. He’s heard them tell tales about the Boneyard, a massive collection of draconic and giant bones. They believe this place to be haunted, but Galen’s read about another version of events, where this was mentioned as a gathering of dragons, giants and elves.

A last ditch effort to try and solve a conflict in a diplomatic way, which clearly didn’t end well, judging the state of the place. He shares this with the others as the captain starts walking ahead, the others following behind her. As she walks ahead, the images and scribbles in the space light up again, until she eventually comes to what appears to be a dead end.

There’s a small crack in the canyon wall; she stands in front of it and says, in Giant, “My beliefs are firm, but my mind is like sand.” A rune above the crack begins to glow as the crack crumbles into sand, revealing another space beyond. She walks in, the others follow, finding themselves in an enclosed space, which feels somewhat claustrophobic. They also realise they’re deeper underground now.

One of the walls in this area exposes a massive stone head, half embedded into the rock, decorated by beautiful swirls around it. There’s a red stone pillar, containing an orb-shaped niche, that juts out of its forehead. The facial expression in the stone is frozen in pain and there’s a semi circle in front of the face, with three stools, one of which the captain sits down on.

Taking a look at the niche, Beck quickly deduces the docent they found might fit in there, so he turns to D4, asking if he brought the orb with him. D4 says he did, but wonders if it’s safe, though he then extends his hand and places the orb anyway.

As he places the orb, they all hear a stone click into place, the swirls around the space animating as the entire wall seems to come to life. The face contorts, animating as well. The eyes seem to be half in the mountain face, so he doesn’t seem to be able to see, but the mouth moves freely. D4 asks if the stone man can hear them, Beck pointing out they’ll find out as he moves forward, sitting down next to the captain, keeping an eye on her.

Her eyes dim and she falls off her stool, finding herself in her own mind again and she seems scared, confused about where she is. Beck tries to assure her, saying he thinks they’re okay and that they’ll catch her up. D4 checks in with her, and she says she’s okay.

Then, the mouth opens, a voice sounding out in Giant, which Beck translates for the others. “You stand before Arag the Dreamwalker. Who may I ask has returned my orb?” Beck tells Arag that they found his orb inside a warforged, and Arag asks if the warforged was accompanied by an elf. “Yes,” Beck offers, “but she was no longer there.” Beck knows that the wagon they found belonged to Velania, who he knows to be an elf.

“It was stolen from me,” Arag says, adding that it was indeed stolen by the elf. He thanks the group for having returned it. “I sensed it’s presence, though I couldn’t… hm. I couldn’t seem to pick up the bearer of the orb.” The group realises he’s talking about D4, who can’t dream because he’s a warforged, and therefore Arag couldn’t pick up on him.

“So, you found this orb on a being similar to him then?” Arag asks, which Beck confirms, also confirming the the elf was nowhere to be found. “How did you know it was an elf?” Beck says he knows the elf, then tells Arag they found the orb in a place called Krezent. Arag asks if that’s where his eye was activated. Beck thinks he means the orb, but Arag says that’s not what he means.

“The eye is my gift from them. The quori, dream spirits. They tell me what to do, and I contact them through my eye. They told me to hide in the stone as they couldn’t stop the evil spirits from taking over.” Beck asks him when this was, and Arag says it was eons ago. “My eye had shattered. The pieces of it have been lost to time. Until recently, one of those pieces was activated. Was that where you found the orb as well?”

“We found the orb in a place that people have been disappearing from,” Beck says, after which Arag asks if they found a gem as well. The wall changes shape, depicting a gem of sorts, which is familiar to Rydia, who turns around, muttering under her breath: “The fourth eye is blinded by the trees.”

Beck turns to the others, asking them if this means anything to them. Rydia turns from Galen to the stone face, still muttering under her breath. “I know,” Galen says to her, “but I still need you right now.” Arag then addresses them in common, asking Rydia directly if she saw his eye. “I saw something,” Rydia admits, but doesn’t offer much more information when Arag asks for it. “Can we change the subject?”

In a loud and booming voice, Arag says ‘No!’, several rocks falling down from the canyon wall. “I need to know where it was activated.” Galen is quick to jump to Rydia’s defense, telling Arag to back off. “My eye was shattered and with it, was the link to Dal’Qor. It’s pieces still occilate, it’s pieces still carry a strong connection to the realm of nightmares.” He insists he needs to know where this was.

Galen tells him that his guess would be that it’s in Krezent, as that seems like a town of nightmares. Rydia tugs at Galen’s jacket, shakes her head, pointing at her side, wordlessly trying to tell him something. She then tells Arag that she saw the gem, pointing at the side of her head; “In here”.

“The realm of dreams occilates incredibly slowly between a realm of nightmares and a realm of unbridled positive imagination. It is us who learned to talk with the positive dream spirits,” Arag explains. “It is us they asked for help when the negative dream spirits started to take over again. This constant struggle between dark and light is happening every day on Dal’Qor. That was more than ten thousand years ago. The positive side should be gaining ground again; all the more reason for the nightmares to grasp at straws and take the Material Plane as their own.”

He goes on to say that if he has his eye, he might be able to communicate with them. “But you don’t know where it is.” He does ask Rydia again about what she saw in her mind. “Any more specifics? Location?” Rydia stares at Galen with a helpless look on her face, but if Galen knows what she’s trying to say, he doesn’t share this with Arag. “She told you what she knows,” he tells Arag, who says he’s disappointed, before asking them to leave.

Galen puts his arm around Rydia and starts to walk away, the captain quick to follow, seemingly eager to get out of this place. D4 follows as well, telling the captain he’s very confused as well. Petr and Beck hang back for a moment, Beck asking Petr if he thinks that Arag might be able to help them with the situation in Krezent. “From what I understood, I suppose so. It’s too big of a coincidence for it to not be linked, right?” Beck agrees, but considering they don’t know where this eye is, neither of them really know what to do with this information.

They agree to go back to the ship, and head back to Gatherhold and share this information with Anders, to see if maybe he or whoever he hires to look into this can do something with the information. Petr points out that maybe Anders might be too pleased with them, to which the captain points out that she thinks they did what he asked.

Heading back, the way back is still illuminated by the strange drawings and carvings, but they find their way out without too much trouble. Getting back aboard the ship, the captain asks the crew to take over for a moment as she’s in need of some sleep, Beck assuring her they’ll take care of it. Petr plots out a new course, knowing where they are because Beck and Galen remembered they were at the Boneyard.

Travel back to Gatherhold is uneventful the first day, though the second day they run into a storm. Thankfully, they make it through relatively unscathed, arriving at Gatherhold around midnight, deciding to camp out on the ship overnight and head into town the following morning. They park the ship a little ways outside of town, deciding that’s likely safer.

As they head into town the following morning, the sun shining brightly, they notice the atmosphere in the town seems very grim all the sudden. There’s still some halflings somewhat celebrating, but the mood as a whole seems to have rapidly shifted from when the group left about four days ago.

The captain decides to stay on board, having been somewhat quiet the past couple of days, so the others head into town without her. Beck, Petr and D4 head off to meet up with Anders, Galen suggesting that he and Rydia go see Orryn to check in with him. They split up, making their way to their respective destinations.

Getting into town, the atmosphere is even more apparent. People seem to be leaving, tents being broken up despite the festivities technically not being over yet. On the way towards Gatherhold Hall, they pick up some conversation left and right about what might’ve happened; apparently there have been some deaths whilst they were aware. Galen, on his way towards Orryn, picks up on some more details: eighteen dead halflings were recovered after a fire at the Glowing Kipper.

Beck, D4 and Petr make their way to Gatherhold Hall, heading into the ornate facade of the building. Anders pokes his head out of one of the two halfling sized doors inside, greeting the group, seemingly glad they’ve made it back. He asks about the captain, Beck explaining she stayed back as she’s a little tired from travelling.

He asks for an update on what happened, if the ghost stories are true. “I suppose that depends on the ghost story,” Beck points out, before relaying to Anders what they found in Krezent. “We found some research there, which seems to indicate that there might be a manifest zone, and there’s a connection to Dal’Qor.” Anders points out there hasn’t been one of those in a while, Beck telling him about their run in with Arag the Dreamwalker, which he thinks adds to the plausibility of the research they found in Krezent. “We also sent in D4’s Zoomer, he found an image of something.”

D4 moves his Zoomer forward, having him project the image they found so Anders can see it as well. Anders stares at it, saying that the creature being there doesn’t seem good. He then asks if they dealt with the creature, which Beck says they haven’t, explaining they felt ill prepared and they wanted to do more research.

Anders says he understands, finding the information they shared so far very helpful. He then asks if there’s anything else they found, Beck telling him they found a docent as well, but they returned it to Arag. He also shares the location of Arag, in case Anders wanted to look into that, or have someone else look into it. Anders recognises the name of the Boneyard, saying even he believes the ghost stories about that place.

He starts rambling in himself about how he might solve this problem, after which Beck points out he thinks they handled their part of the deal, also telling Anders he’s not ruling out they’re unwilling to help him with this, they just want some more information first. Anders admits he’s not happy about the news they gave him, but he also knows better than to shoot the messenger. “I would’ve hoped there was nothing going on and we could’ve resumed our activities in the mine without further interference, but it seems that’s not the case. I’d still say you’ve definitely earned your purse.”

Heading into his office, he then returns with a sack containing five hundred gold, handing it to Beck. “I believe this was the agreed upon price and this was a testing ground, so to speak, to see if we could trust each other and see eye to eye.” Considering they pulled him out of a building that burned down hours later, he thinks they’re definitely able to see eye to eye. He then mentions the flying mounts, saying he’s willing to tell them where to find them.

“There’s a base, floating above Lake Cyre. It’s permanently shrouded in fog, so most people haven’t seen it. But it is a floating earth moat, that functions as one of our military bases and is used as a training facility to guide the creatures.” The Talenta Military has been long disbanded, he points out, saying they stopped with war on a professional level when the treaty of Thronehold was signed, but the creatures are still there. “If you manage to capture all of them, you can keep as many as you like; I would like to be able to take the rest, maybe sell them.”

Beck asks how many there’s meant to be there, Anders saying there should be a whole colony, about twenty of them. Anders goes on to say he’s already had some talks with the House that’s in charge of animal training. They had no way of getting to this floating place, but now that he knows the airship crew, he has a way to get to it.

He and Beck shake hands on a deal well done, before Beck asks him if he’s heard anything more about this fire that took place. Anders doesn’t know anything more about who caused the fire, but considering he was there, he’s aware that the group weren’t responsible for the fire. He also points out he’d rather not talk about this; he’d prefer his link to an organisation like the Daask is not brought up.

“Let me know if you’re ever interested in more work,” Anders then says, with Beck saying they’ll now where to find him. Before they say their good-byes, D4 asks about docents, so Anders shares a little more information about them. He recommends D4 finds one, saying House Cannith makes them. When D4 asks where he’d be able to find one, Anders saying they’d be available to nobility, as House Cannith always felt they were of higher standing than most others. D4 thanks him for the info, and they say their good-byes.

Meanwhile, Galen and Rydia have made their way over the Salty Hag, from where they’re redirected to the warehouse, where Orryn is supposed to be. They make their way there and are let inside by a goblin who recognises Galen. The warehouse is a relatively dark space, inside which there’s a small boat filled with burlap sacks. There’s five goblins, dressed in rubber-y suits that they’re slowly taking off. They also have some glowing scimitars; these guys have just returned from the Mournland.

Orryn, looking giddily at the new loot, notices Galen and Rydia and immediately changes posture and composure, greeting them. “There you are, excellent. You didn’t leave any trails behind when you set that thing ablaze, did ya? I mean, the entire town is talking about it, they’re probably gonna do an investigation, stuff like that …” Galen assures him he has nothing to worry about, but Orryn says its still not sitting right with him.

Galen asks about where the bodies were found, Orryn confirming it was in the cave down below. “Did you hear about the airship crew already, are they onboard with Q’barra?” he then asks, changing the subject. Galen confirms this, though adds that they want to do another job first.

As they continue their conversation, the burlap sacks get turned inside out, and a bunch of trinkets fall out. Books, chalices, candelabras; all Cyrian in design. Things that will sell well to the Mourners. Galen points out it seems Orryn’s having a good day, who gets giddy about the loot again. “Alright, I won’t ruin your fun, I just wanted to check in,” Galen says, before telling Orryn they’ll probably be out of town for a few days, but he’ll check back in after that.

He and Rydia then head back to meet up with the others again. On their way back, Galen notices this halfling that’s walking towards him, eyeing him strangely. Both he and Rydia are trying to remember where they know her from before realising she’s a bell hop at the hotel. She recognises them too, approaching them, saying they’ve been looking all over for them.

“About three days ago a guest arrived for you,” she tells Galen. “Asking about you.” Galen asks who this person is. “Didn’t leave a name: older gentleman, dressed perfectly; the thing is though, he’s been sitting in the same seat for three days. Hasn’t eaten, hasn’t drunk. He refuses to leave, keeps saying ‘they’re coming right back.” She asks Galen to please meet with the man, and as Galen says he will, she seems relieved.

She looks between Galen and Rydia, then asking them if they have time now. Galen says they have to meet someone first, convincing her that they’ll come back later. She asks them to please tell her manager that it was her who found them; her name is Clarissa. Galen promises to do so.

Waiting til she leaves, Galen immediately tells Rydia that they shouldn’t go back there. He says to Rydia that he doesn’t know who this man is, which is what’s scaring me. “An older guy in fancy clothes? That could be anyone.” They wonder about how this man might’ve found them, before deciding to go over there to see who it is, Galen admitting he’s curious about who this man is.

Rydia suggests they find their new friends and head in with them, both of them agreeing that if things turn south, their new friends can be canon fodder. They continue on towards Gatherhold Hall, both groups catching each other up on what happened and what they found out.

Beck mentions that he’d like to figure out who set the fire, Galen saying that Orryn assumes it was them. “If Orryn assumes it, someone else who looks into it might as well.” He adds that he doesn’t like potentially being blamed for something they didn’t do. Galen theorizes the Daask burnt down their own place, but he doesn’t know why they would do that. He then points out he has a quick errand to run at the hotel, the others agreeing to go with him.

They head towards the Gold Dragon Inn, where it’s busy with bell hops and personnel rushing about. In the lobby, they see, seated on a luxurious seat made out of dinosaur leather, staring into oblivion, an immaculately dressed man with an air of nobility. He’s wearing a white suit, white blouse, short well coiffed hair and a face that seems rather emotionless. On the chair next to him sits a small, flat jewellery box.

Galen heads to the reception first, telling them that Clarissa sent him, mentioning the gentleman. The man is pointed out to him and Galen makes his way over, taking a seat next to this man. His face comes to life a bit as he sits down and he greets Galen. “Good day, Mister D’Arcy I presume.” Galen doesn’t recognise him.

“My name is Mortem Pent,” he says right as the scent of his cologne becomes obvious to Galen. “I’m here of behalf of our mutual acquaintance, Misses Vidante. She’s quite worried about your well-being.” He mentions Galen getting into a lot of trouble recently, before he reaches for the jewellery box and hands it to Galen. “This ought to keep you a bit safer.”

Galen opens the box, revealing a pocket watch with a silver chain. The pocket watch has a strange blue glow, and the lid of it is a golden skull, something that looks somewhat familiar to Galen. “What if I’m not interested in the gifts she has to offer?” Pent says then he’ll return it, but points out it would be foolish to turn down this gift. It’s quite a powerful magic item.

“How’d you find me?” Galen asks, instead of acknowledging that. “I believe you stared into a similar skull quite recently, Mr D’Arcy,” Pent points out. Galen tells him he can tell the lady he’s not interested in her protection or her charity. Pent says he’ll pass that along, before saying there’s another reason she wanted them to meet in person. “She believes you’ve taken an interest in a certain tome. Have you any inkling on where this most holiest of books might be? It’s quite important for me and my people.”

Galen says he hasn’t got the faintest idea, Mortem seemingly unaware he’s not telling the truth. “Well, this turns out to be a big disappointment, I’m not going to lie,” Pent says, to which Galen apologises for wasting his time.

For a moment, he sits there quite dishevelled, Galen noticing a moth flying out of the man’s suit. “I think we’re done here,” Galen says, to which Mortem agrees, saying good bye to Galen before getting up. He dusts off his suit, a large amount of dust coming off despite him looking impeccably dressed. He then starts walking away.

Immediately after, one of the serving staff walks up to Galen, seemingly very glad that the man just left. “Have you heard of clients that stay for more than three days, don’t order anything, I mean, how are you supposed to stay hospitable in a situation like that?” The staff member then asks what the man wanted, to which Galen says it was nothing important. “Well that’s disappointing to say the least.”
