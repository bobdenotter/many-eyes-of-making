# Not Fun Tentacles (or NFTs)
In the last day before they leave for the Mournland everyone undertakes some last preparations. Bonzo upgrades Betsy, replacing her legs with four dragonshards that allow her to float, and gets himself better armor. Rydia takes the mithril armor that Galen found and dons it. Petr has gone out and collected some bugs in jars that he brings with him and Beck spends some time at a temple to Olladra, which also functions as a gambling house. H

He draws a card from his wife’s tarot deck, which turns out to be a reversed ‘the World’, meaning ‘seeking closure, short-cuts, delays’. 

The following morning, they all gather at the Exalted Order of Aureon, where Lina introduces them to the three other mages that will be accompanying them. There is Novac Vishara (a young, rogue-ish looking fellow carrying an impressive looking spellbook), Belliyana Toppe (a dwarven woman carrying spell scrolls in abundance), Quillek Aeyliros (a fray old man carrying a number of clockwork like devices on his belt). 

Lina explains that she and Novac are the ones the group will be escorting into the Mournland, whereas Belliyana and Quillek will stay behind near the teleportation circle they’ll be teleporting to, to do some tests of their own. 

As they’re getting ready to leave, Esme says goodbye to her wife, and then turns to Galen, urging him to be careful. With the teleportation circle completed, Lina urges everyone to move in close, telling them they’ll only have a few seconds once the spell is activated. She briefly explains they’ll be going to Yuthros’ Tower and then the spell is activated and everyone steps through the teleportation circle. 

They emerge in what seems to be an underground basement, with a small ladder leading up to a hatch in the ceiling. The air is notably stale, the lack of oxygen noticeable and it makes the crew all the more aware that they’re only able to breathe thanks to the potions that they took beforehand. 

The room they emerge in is cramped, not due to the amount of people suddenly in it, but because of huge spikes of glass that seem to take up part of the area. Lina welcomes the crew to the Mournland, explaining to the crew that this tower belongs to Yuthros, a wizard who used to belong to the Order as well. They haven’t heard from him since the Mourning and assume he passed, but his teleportation circle was still active, so they’ve been using that to travel here. 

The tower is located just outside of Making, the city itself being roughly three hours of travel away from here. They start making their way outside, Rydia turning to Belliyana and taking a good look at her before telling her that she’ll be checking in every hour. Belliyana in turn introduces the group to her white furred, winged cat, Slobberchops, saying that if they need help, they can tell the cat and she and Quillek can try and do something. 

Lina leads the way outside of the basement, the crew following her out. Once they make it out, it becomes very clear that the upper floors of the tower have long since collapsed. Before them they see a mountain range of black stone, with a road leading ahead, seemingly still intact. Far in the distance, they can see the city of Making. 

As they look around, they realise the area seems to be mostly made up out of glass, or moreso sand that has been cooked and turned into glass. Belliyana explains that there’s three ways to get to the city; through the mountains, by following the road, and going straight across the plains. 

During a quick discussion on which road they should take, dark clouds can be seen gathering in the distance, slowly moving closer. It is somewhat quickly decided that they should take the road through the mountains, and that seems to offer slightly more cover and as none of them are familiar with this environment, that seems safest. Beck recalls there’s a large dam near the mountains as well, that used to power the city. 

Before they leave, they ask Belliyana about what kind of things she’s seen in her brief missions out to the Mournland. A dark looks seems to cross the dwarf’s face before she describes mutated creatures, pointing out that Rydia and Galen look quite normal compared to what she’s seen. 
They start making their way towards the mountains, walking across this strange, glass-like surface. As they keep going, the group’s features seem to start distorting and as they pass by a large reflective shard sticking out of the ground, they realise they all look like somewhat ghoulish. Though it looks unsettling, they manage to shake it off and keep going.

It’s not long til they reach a large, ominous looking mountain lake. A hissing sound catches the group’s attention and they realise that the rain coming from the large clouds they spotted earlier seems to be coming down and is burning away pieces of metal. 

On the other end of the lake they notice a large structure, which Beck figures is the dam he remembered being there. They decide to go around the lake, around the right, as that seems to be the faster way. As they move along it, Galen and Beck spot a massive form gliding through the water. It’s moving slowly, but momentarily does seem to be approaching the group.

The others spot the creature too as it momentarily partially surfaces, glimmers of scales and metal drawing the crew’s attention before the creature sees to dive deeper into the lake. 

They keep going, spotting the path that heads back down the mountains up ahead and making their way towards it. In the distance, they spot what looks to be a hanger bay, realising it seems to be some sort of depot related to the lightning rail, as tracks run inside of it. 

As they make their way closer, one of the darker clouds they spotted earlier floats in through the mountains, moving faster than any normal cloud would. Something large stirs inside the cloud and as it gets closer, a large collection of tentacles starts reaching out of it like limbs.

The group quickly realises that whatever this is, it isn’t friendly, and combat ensues. Both Galen and Bonzo get pulled in by the creature’s tentacles as the others try to fight it off, and though Bonzo almost gets eaten, the group eventually manages to defeat it. Beck’s Bigby’s Hand picks up Bonzo and Rydia and he deals the final blow with a Synaptic Static. 

In the distance, they can see the creature they saw in the lake approaching, but thankfully they’re somewhere it can’t seem to reach them. It does emerge from the water for a moment, five heads screeching out loudly as the creature, seemingly made out of a strange combination of glass, flesh and metal, calls out before diving back down into the water. 

Both Bonzo and Galen fell into the water during the fight, but though a strange oily film seems to cling to their skin, they manage to shake of whatever adverse effect that might’ve had on them. Bonzo heals himself a little and the group then continues on.

They take note of the hangar bay again, noting some House Orien unicorns depicted on the seven hangars in total. There’s one lightning rail train there as well, half in and out of a hanger, but there doesn’t seem to be any electricity in this station. Strangely, Petr and Galen do spot some flickering lights in one of the buildings, but though the group’s curious, they decide to press on, as time is precious. 

As they continue on towards the city of Making, Lina points out they hope to be back home before dinner, reminding everyone these are supposed to be in-and-out kind of trips. She also points out that those trips would be even easier if they were to find a teleportation circle inside of Making itself, Beck sharing that he recalls House Cannith making use of one whenever they visited Making. 

They continue on towards the city, spotting a platoon of warforged by the road, all of them broken down and damaged in some way or another. As they get closer to the city, they leave the mountains beside and converge onto the road, now out onto the plains that lead towards the city. Up ahead, they can see that what Beck knows to be the Trade Gate into Making still seems to be intact. 

In fact, most of the city seems intact, except for a part of it towards the back, where a massive glass shard seems to have almost impaled part of the city. As they get closer, they spot a platoon of individuals outside of the gate. They look frozen, an army of statues made up out of dozens of individuals. 

As they get closer, they can see that all these individuals seem to have turned into glass. The group is made up out of humans, elves, hobgoblins and the way they’re frozen seems to indicate this happened in a split second. Some of them look quite frightened. 

Beck wonders out loud if this is something that’s reversible, Novac taking a look at these glass statues and suggesting that perhaps that is a way. Galen speaks up, warning Beck against going down that road, to which Beck says that he promises not to get his hopes up. 

As they move further into the city, there’s a hush of wind and a foul mechanical stench overwhelms Rydia, Lina and Beck, all three of them strangely intoxicated all the sudden. Bonzo recognises the smell of ethanol and is quick to approach Lina, casting Lesser Restoration on her. This seems to snap her out of it.

Not wanting Rydia to get to enjoy being drunk on the job when he can’t, Petr does the same for her, leaving Beck as the only one still intoxicated by this vapor. He pulls out his violin and starts playing a song as he moves further into the city, trying to remember where the House Cannith location was that had a teleportation circle. 

Bonzo and Rydia linger for a moment, trying to figure out where this sudden smell came from. Bonzo deduces it seems to have come from the east, calling out to Beck and asking him if he knows what’s to the east. Beck doesn’t recall specifics, but does know there’s a large garden, or park area, to the east of the city. It was sponsored by House Cannith, though he doesn’t recall the name of the place. It was home to, amongst other things, exotic plants and such. 

As they continue deeper into the city, they note that strangely, nothing really seems wrong. They’re walking down a large boulevard, which leads them from the outer ring of the city (consisting mostly out of commercial and domestic houses) further towards the middle ring (which contains mostly House Cannith locations) and eventually, to the center, where the palace is. 

Now that they’re actually in the city, they get a better view at this enormous glass shard, realising that it has destroyed half the city. 

Rounding a corner, they’re met with the strange sound of what seems to be meat hitting stone, and the sight of six bodies, seemingly convulsing on the ground. They appear to be four humans, a dwarf and a half-elf. 

Most of the group stays outside, observing this strange display, as Rydia and Galen head into a house, trying to figure out what exactly happened here and why there don’t seem to be a lot of people. They find a family home, where most everything is covered in a layer of dust. Looking around, they deduce that the people who lived here apparently packed up their things and seemingly left in a hurry.

Meanwhile, outside, the rest watch as the convulsing half-elf’s mouth opens. His jaw unhinges and something crawls out of his throat - something that looks suspiciously like a brain.

Novac, not about to find out what this brain creature might be, instantly decides he’s done and fireballs the entire situation. This successfully seems to kill everyone, except the dwarf, which also starts convulsing. Rydia and Galen walk back out, asking what the hell is going on, the others explaining that a brain just crawled out of the mouth of that half-elf.

Rydia attempts to telepathically connect to the dwarf as he starts to convulse as well, but all she hears is a pained scream. With an Eldritch Blast, she puts her out of her misery. 

As the group tries to make sense of this all, Galen points out he still has a Talenta Death Mask, which allows him to speak to the death. Lina is in favor of this plan, pointing out they did come here to find answers, so Galen takes out the mask and places it on one of the now dead humans. 

He starts by asking this human who he is and is given the name Lucius Taveil in response. Lucius shared that he did live in Making. When asked what the last thing he remembers is, he recalls seeing the scouts of Yonhanna. 

“We were sent into the city to discern the effects of Yonhanna’s creatures on the living. She rarely comes out of Clawrift, but we found them.” He goes on to say that the creatures were strolling around like the Mourning didn’t happen, but they weren’t in their own mind. “All eyes of Yonhanna.” 

With the last question answered, the body slumps back down and the crew is left to discuss what that might mean. Beck, by now somewhat sobered up, and Galen talk about how that seems to mean that people were here after the Mourning, and it also seems to mean that Yonhanna might still be here, alive and well down in Clawrift. As they were already planning on investigating Clawrift, they make note of keeping that in mind, but for now they all agree that finding the teleportation circle takes precedence. 

They continue onwards into town, passing by a small unassuming temple dedicated to Onatar. There’s a small reflection pool in front of it. The temple itself seems to have been desecrated; all metal things have been taken from it and there’s a strange symbol spraypainted on the wall. It’s a collection of lines that Bonzo recognises as the symbol of the Becoming God.

Beck deduces this desecration happened somewhat recently, as Bonzo shares some more about what he recently learned about the warforged. His father is working on an article on the warforged and he uncovered some things that the warforged didn’t want him to know. One of those things was that they’re gathering under the Lord of Blades and are apparently trying to create a God out of what are essentially spare parts. 

This leads to a brief discussion on the creation and existence of Gods, but they don’t linger on it too long. Bonzo takes the time to clean up the temple, Beck helping him out as the others stay outside. As he looks through the temple, Bonzo finds a hidden door, behind which he finds a holy symbol. It’s a bronze plaque with a necklace attached. He uses the necklace to replace the anvil that is usually present in these temples (but in this case has been stolen / taken out), which he thinks will successfully take care of the desecration.

After he does this, a feeling of calm washes over Bonzo and his own holy symbol lights up as Onatar blesses him with a temporary boon: a Charm of Restoration. 

With the temple now in a better state, the group continues onwards, noting the train station of Making up ahead. There’s flickering illusion magic decorating some of the buildings around it; old advertisements for bars and other such places. The doors leading into the train station are open and there they spot another group of people seemingly turned into glass.

Notably, some of these people seem to be hugging the air, or patting a non-existent person on the back; it seems that whilst some people here turned to glass, others simply disappeared. 

From here, in the distance, they can see a darkened district with industrial buildings and a large looming tower in the center.
