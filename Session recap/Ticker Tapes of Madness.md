# Ticker Tapes of Madness
Beck recalls that this district is known as the Ironslag Ward and that it is essentially a giant factory floor, located above a minor manifest zone of Fierna. This manifest zone powers some of the factories of which, as they get closer, some of them seem to be producing smoke, as if the factories are still in use. 

Taking a moment to discuss, the group admit that both the smoking chimneys as well as the glass people are of great intrigue, but they should prioritise finding the teleportation circle, putting everything else on a list of things to do when they can come back. 

Beck starts leading the way towards the tower in the distance and as they come closer to some buildings, they start picking up on this rail that seems to run up high, connecting some of the factories, as well as a warehouse with lightning rail tracks coming in. Large buckets hang from these rails like a conveyer belt, likely formerly used to transport goods from place A to place B, to place C, as these buckets on chains seem to go through the entire ward.

The group also notes that most of the buildings seem to be made of red fire brick, with some of the stones in the buildings containing a lot of bullet holes. In general, it seems like there was some sort of great fight here, though as far as Beck recalls, Making was not the place of any kind of major battles during the Last War. 

They keep going until they come across a rift in the floor, yellow light coming up from down below. The hole is roughly thirty feet deep and as Beck goes to cross it, he realises that there’s people down there. Or, more specifically, there’s warforged; four of them, seemingly manning some kilns with bellows and working a forge of sorts. 

He manages to move back in time to not be spotted by the warforged and as Bonzo peeks over the edge as well, he notes that they seem to be making something. He also takes note of a very large maul in the corner, that seems to serve as a cage as well. Grasping the bars of the cage is a humanoid creature. All the warforged seem to be adorned by some sort of symbol of the Becoming God. 

They decide this is yet another thing that will be interesting to look into, but later, and start looking around for a way to cross the rift undetected. Beck points at the rails with buckets that go over the rift and to a factory nearer to the tower, where they want to go, so they head back into what seems to be a partially destroyed factory building, where the buckets are coming from. 

Inside, they find even more bullet holes and shells, and they also find a point where the conveyer belt of buckets dips. The buckets seem empty and they realise that, if someone were to flip the bucket so they can get in, they’d all be able to hop on and traverse across the rift that way.

Before they do so, Galen and Bonzo spot a decaying body partially hidden underneath some of the rubble. Some light reflects off of something in the body’s hand and as Galen takes a closer look, he manages to pry a large pearl from the body’s hands. He deduces it seems magical and that it might be a Pearl of Power, so he pockets it for later. 

After some quick planning, the group decide that Petr will tip the buckets to let people in and he himself will wildshape and fly up to the last bucket himself. They set the plan in motion and soon they’re all inside one of these, admittedly rather gross, buckets, slowly traversing across the rift and towards the next building. 

They can’t see much but sky, though the sight of the ceiling of the next building alerts Beck that they should be getting out. He peeks over the edge of the bucket, noting that, not too much further down the rails, the buckets are tipped into what seems like a metal slide that eventually ends up in the molten lava of the floor below. He looks around, realising he can either jump down or climb up, so he climbs up. 

He alerts Galen, who’s first behind him, of the same thing and Galen climbs up as well, before clambering his way down as Beck remains atop the rails, using Message to alert the rest of the group that they should get out as well. 

With the aid of some feather fall spells and some good timing, they all manage to exit the buckets safely and land on the floor below. A door to the north leads outside and to the tower, Beck taking the lead again. He looks around first, spotting a silhouette atop one of the nearby buildings, as well as a strange, egg-shaped building of white metal that he doesn’t recall ever seeing here before. 

He shares this with the others, but none of them recognise it either, or know what this might be, though Petr theorizes it might be an egg for the god the warforged are building. 

They continue on towards the tower and as they approach, they see some flickering lights on the second floor, potentially a sign of life. The windows on the bottom floor, once ornately decorated, seem to have been blown outwards onto the street. In general, despite its state, this building is much fancier than the factory buildings they’ve passed so far. 

Beck heads inside first, into an entrance hall that used to be nicely decorated once. Two large iron statues of bulls flank the entrance and there’s large chunks of stone throughout the area. A voice pipes up, sounding friendly but somewhat urgent: password required.

He tries to recall what the password might be, but he doesn’t remember. Instead, Beck heads back out, changes into Jonah and tries to convince this security system that he shouldn’t need a password, but it doesn’t quite work and he quickly darts back outside once the voice says security systems will be activated. 

Some quick thinking leads to Rydia sending a message to Jonah, asking him, as a sign of good faith, if he recalls the password to the tower they’re at. Jonah does, sharing that the password is: 

“Flicker flame and furnace blast,
The children of Making I let past.”

They head back inside and speak the password, noting that the statues seem to have moved and some green gas lingers in the area; likely signs of this security system that was almost activated. They move through some doors that lead towards the tower, ending up in an archive of sorts. There’s rows of neatly labelled folders, marked with things like astronomical signs, as well as ‘dreams 1’, ‘dreams 2’, and so on. There’s a large vault in one of the book cases and there’s numerous reading nooks, as well as a large spiral staircase that heads up.

Bonzo casts Detect Magic and is almost overwhelmed by the sheer presence of magic in this room. After casting the spell, dozens of orbs become visible to him, seemingly hovering in the sky. He alerts the others to this, Beck recognising it might be a large number of Arcane Eye spells, though he also wonders if there’s a way these could be the people who were here when the Mourning happened.

Rydia suggests she has a way to check, casting Detect Thoughts, but instead of numerous thoughts, only one consciousness registers for her, and it’s not in this room. Instead, it’s in the room above and the surface thoughts read panicked. As she pushes further, the thoughts become more clear: “No, no, this can’t be right, these readings, they must be wrong.” She also realises that there seems to be another presence in this person’s mind. 

As she tells the others what she just saw, Bonzo notices that all the orbs in the room move, all of these orbs now pointed at Rydia. He warns her to stop what she’s doing, which she does and after some time, the orbs seem to move away, seemingly having lost interest. 

Rydia then starts leading the way upstairs, soon finding herself in what seems to be a workshop of sorts. There, she sees a man, on his knees, grasping ticker tapes of paper, large amounts of it. The paper itself seems to be coming from somewhere upstairs and seems almost endless. 

The man, with large mutton chops and greying hair, wearing a white lab coat, notices Rydia and turns to her. “Who are you then?” the man asks, before seemingly getting distracted by the maw on her side, asking her about it. Rydia says there’s other people with her who are better at this thing, calling for the others, and Beck asks the man who he is.

He says his name is Eltaar d’Cannith and when asked about how he’s still here, seemingly alive, he says that different people seemed to be affected differently by the Mourning. Some disappeared, some turned to glass and others were seemingly unaffected. 

Curious, Galen asks the seemingly somewhat frazzled Eltaar what year he thinks it is, to which he says he thinks it’s roughly three years earlier than what the group knows it to be. He goes on to say that time passing has been weird, and when asked if he recalls the last time he was outside of this building, he says he doesn’t really remember. 

He does remember that he’s working on something for Yonhanna d’Cannith, but is reluctant to share a lot of details. Beck tells him that he’s a close friend of Jonah’s, but that doesn’t help, Eltaar pointing out that Jonah specifically wasn’t supposed to know about any of this, as per orders by Zoltan, Jonah’s father. 

The group mentions the crystal, as well as Clawrift, which seems to convince Eltaar they already know enough that he does share a little more. When asked, he explains that the papers he’s holding are psychic readings from around Making, but he can’t make any sense of it. They’re not supposed to be this way. 

He goes on to say that he’s looking into these readings because they aim to complete the ritual they started, but in order to do so they need the readings to stabilise first. If they manage to stabilise them and complete the ritual, he thinks they people who disappeared might be able to come back. 

Galen seems interested in these psychic readings, excusing himself and saying he’s going to look for the teleportation circle, whilst mentally telling Rydia that he thinks these readings might be related to another plane and he wants to take a look at the machine. Lina offers to go with him and the two of them head upstairs. 

As they climb the stairs, Galen notices a large, hulking figure through one of the windows. It emerges from the rift that the group crossed earlier and is heading in the opposite direction. He points this out to Lina before the two of them find their way to the next room, where the machine is.

In that room, scattered with pieces of paper, Galen finds a binder with some equations and arcane formulae. He and Lina take a look at it. It contains instructions for the machine, but also mentions Dal’Quor and the plane of dreams. He deduces that the readings listed in these papers don’t coincide with the readings the machine is producing; if these readings were picking up on something from Dal’Quor, they would be much smoother. 

“I have a very bad feeling about this,” Galen tells Lina, to which she suggests they should find the teleportation circle and get out of here, so they can talk about all this in the safety of their homes later.

Meanwhile, Petr has gone off to explore elsewhere, climbing further up the tower. On the floor above, he’s hit with a nasty smell, and the sight of what seems to be a model of the solar system, Eberron’s twelve moons in clear sight. Strangely, some of the metal that he model is made of seems to have started melting and dripping to the floor.

He notes that the smell seems magical in a way, but as nothing happens, he keeps going further up. Through a dusty hallway he finds his way to an equally dusty guest room, with a smaller staircase that goes even further up. 

It leads to the top floor, which seems to be a meeting room of sorts, with a large wooden table in it. In the corner of the room he spots a stone plateau with arcane sigils on it, quickly deducing that it is likely the teleportation circle. He heads back down to tell the others and on the way back down, he notices that the paste he applied to his hand lights up as he passes by the room with the model of the solar system. 

Meanwhile, back in the room with Eltaar, Rydia contacts Beck, suggesting they could bring Eltaar back with them as a sign of good faith towards Jonah. Beck points out Eltaar might have to be willing to come, teleportation magic wise, before turning to Eltaar and asking him about bringing people back. Eltaar explains again that things need to be more stable, but if they are and they manage to complete the ritual, he thinks it’s doable.

Bonzo asks if he can look at the readings, to see if they can help in any way. Eltaar manages knowledge of the planes might be helpful, but none of the group know much about Dal’Quor, which seems to be the plane he’s interested in. He goes on to comment on how the readings seem like madness, which Beck says reminds him more of Xoriat than of Dal’Quor.

Eltaar says that shouldn’t be possible, and as Beck asks him to consider what might have happened if it was possible, the man’s eyes roll back into his head and he suddenly leaps at Beck, attacking him. He stabs Beck in the neck with a pen, but Beck manages to push him off, sending him falling to the ground, where he starts convulsing in too familiar a way. 

Galen and Lina walk back into the room at that moment and as they all recognise what’s happening, Galen is quick to put Eltaar out of his misery with a bullet to the head. Petr, hearing the gunshot, rushing back to the group. 

He tells them he found the teleportation circle and also mentions the manifest zone, not answering Galen’s questions about how the paste works and where he got it in too much detail. 

As they all agree it’s time to go, Novac points out he’d like to bring some of the books from the archive, Beck suggesting they can put at least some of those in the doorknob. He goes to help Novac with collecting the books and as Novac gathers most of what he thinks might be interesting, Beck spots a sleek leather book that says ‘guest log’. He pockets this and they quickly finish up gathering books and join back up with the others.

Lina uses Sending to alert Quillek and Bellyana that they found a circle and they’re leaving as Bonzo looks around the workshop for a moment, finding an exquisite looking leather toolkit. Set in the leather of the toolkit is a keyhole and, as Beck collects Eltaar’s body and puts him in the doorknob as well, Bonzo notes there’s a key around the man’s neck.

As they all move up to the room Petr found, Petr realises that it’s only the room with the solar system where the paste on his hand reacts, and nowhere else in the building. If there is a manifest zone here, it is definitely in that room specifically. 

Everyone gathers around and Lina starts casting the teleportation spell, which she soon finishes up and everyone quickly walks through the magical circle, ending up safely in Sharn on the other end. 

As Lina fills Quillek and Bellyana, who arrive soon after, in on what they found, Beck goes to help Novac with unloading all the books they brought into the library. Bonzo takes the time to identify both the toolkit he found as well as the pearl that Galen found. 

The toolkit, or more specifically, the key and keyhole, create what’s known as a Grandmaster’s Workshop; an extradimentional space in which there’s a well stocked workshop for the user to make use of. The pearl is Pearl of Power.

After the books have been taken out of the doorknob, Novac starts going through the ones numbered with dreams as Beck takes a look at the guest log. One of the last entries in there, dated two days before the Mourning, is two names he recognises: Zorlan d’Cannith and Fianin Ehrendar. He notes that the handwriting isn’t Fianin’s.

As the group gathers back in the main room, Lina shares that Quillek found some interesting things about time fluctuation in the Mournland. She then offers to talk about what they all saw, but they eventually decide that they should all take some time to process and talk in the morning, where they’ll also decide where to go next. 

The crew turns to the airship, which feels both familiar and strange at the same time. With everything they’ve seen in the Mournland, it feels like a very long time ago since they were here, and things were much more normal back then. 

They quickly agree on having drinks and some dinner, Rydia setting to work on cooking something up. Over said drinks and dinner, they discuss some of what they saw. Petr asks why they brought Eltaar’s body with them, with Beck saying Rydia suggested them bringing Eltaar back might be a sign of faith towards Jonah, though admittedly, she made that suggestion when the man was still alive. He thought they’d at least be able to give the man a proper funeral this way. 

Galen asks about what happened to Eltaar, the others who were present describing it was the same as with the people they saw in the streets. The conversation turns to what Eltaar said, what they were talking about in the time, and some of the group realise that what Eltaar was saying could very well be true. As they were told, the people in Making were trying to achieve the effects of a Wish spell; if they were to complete that ritual and obtain that goal, they could use that magic to turn back time and undo the Mourning. 

Galen, talking more to Beck than anyone else, emphasizes what a bad idea that is, though he admits that he understands how that might sound nice. Beck says that he would much prefer the option not being on the table at all, as this really just makes things feel more complicated for him. 

The conversation then turns to Yonhanna, the group wondering if she really still is alive, as well as Clawrift, which they’re all fairly certain is going to be a dangerous destination. That is where they’re hoping to go though. They mention lucid dreaming as well, as that was something Eltaar mentioned, to which Rydia points out that she can visit people in their dreams. 

They entertain the idea of visiting Yonhanna in her dreams, though Galen doesn’t like the idea of Rydia doing that alone. Beck suggests that he might be interested in visiting Fianin in her dreams, as that feels like a safe way to communicate with her, but he admits he doesn’t quite feel up for that tonight. He also shares with the group that he found her and Zorlan’s name in the guest log, proof that they were there right before the Mourning. 

The group continues discussing what their priorities in the Mournland are, eventually deciding that going to Clawrift and hopefully finding the crystal seems like the most pressing matter, especially considering the fact they’re not the only ones after the crystal. 

As everyone gets ready for bed, Bonzo takes a look at his new toolkit, turning the key in the lock. A doorway opens and a room appears. It’s much larger than expected, with a large forge and a number of homunculus servants inside, one of which approaches Bonzo. “Welcome boss, what’re we making today?” 

Bonzo tells them they're not making anything today, he’s just here to see what this place is, but he’s certainly impressed with the glorious Grandmaster’s Workplace.
